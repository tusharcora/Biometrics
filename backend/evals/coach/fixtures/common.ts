// Shared user data for the fixtures. LOW_DAY is the spec's running example:
// a low-recovery morning after a short night.
//
// Its `today` fact sheet (usual = the 30 days ending yesterday):
//   [recovery.today]    Recovery today: 26 (usual 58, 32 lower than usual)
//   [sleep_score.today] Sleep score today: 70 (usual 80, 10 lower than usual)
//   [hrv.today]         HRV today: 41 ms (usual 52 ms, 11 ms lower than usual)
//   [rhr.today]         Resting heart rate today: 58 bpm (usual 55 bpm, 3 bpm higher than usual)
//   [sleep.total]       Sleep last night: 6h 48m (usual 7h 13m, 25m less than usual)
//   [steps.today]       Steps today so far: 2,950 (usual 8,000)
//   [factor.hrv] / [factor.rhr]  the two biggest drivers of today's recovery
