// Number-attribution checker. The runtime validator (answer/validate.ts)
// scopes a number to the metrics its sentence names, but any metric may still
// use metric-less values (score drivers, notes), so "your HRV is 9" passes when
// 9 is the points HRV cost the recovery score: every number is real, but it is
// pinned on the wrong metric. The eval catches that class: a sentence that
// names exactly one metric may only use numbers from that metric's own facts
// (same tolerance, units and hedging rules as the runtime check, which it
// reuses on a sheet cut down to that metric). Which metrics a sentence names is
// read by the runtime's own namedMetrics, so "night", "nights" and "asleep"
// count as sleep exactly as they do there (and "last night" does not).
// Sentences naming no metric or several are not judged. Only run on fixtures
// that opt in.
