 * "MAD" is the spec's literal RAW median absolute deviation, not the
 * sigma-scaled 1.4826 x MAD used for z-scores in Stage 3. The raw form is the
 * stricter rule (5 raw MAD is ~3.4 sigma-scaled), which is what a screen for
 * sensor artifacts wants.
 *
 * The trailing window is built from the RAW prior points, rejected ones
 * included. Building it from accepted points only would lock the filter onto a
 * user's old level after a genuine shift (every new value rejected, the median
 * never moving); the median is robust enough to shrug off a few artifacts.
 *
 * For RESTING_HR (a daily-minimum-BPM proxy) this is the only guard against a
 * single artifact-low reading, and a milder dip still inside 5 MAD passes
 * through: a stated limitation, not a solved problem.
