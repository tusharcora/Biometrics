// The camp's clock (spec 2026-10-07 social §6). The night SCENE is 19:00–05:59 local (stars, the banner's night
// line). The "Say goodnight" BUTTON has its own window (owner ruling Q1): from min(20:00, bedtime goal − 60 min) —
// 20:00 with no goal — to 05:59 in the author's zone. A goodnight said between 00:00 and 05:59 belongs to the previous
// evening. On time = at or before the bedtime goal + 15 min, or 23:00 local with no goal; a goal before noon is after
// midnight. A camp note clears at the next 06:00 in its author's zone. The fire has five segments by the share of the
// camp in bed on time; a night is "lit" at three, and a past night is frozen: its camp is the viewer plus the buddies
// paired by that evening's 19:00 (owner ruling Q2). Pure functions, no I/O. An unknown zone reads as UTC everywhere,
// as localCivilDateOrUtc does.
