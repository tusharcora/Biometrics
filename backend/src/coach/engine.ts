// backend/src/coach/engine.ts
// Which model answers a message (spec 2026-09-30 section 3). Local by
// default; the hosted model only when the user chose it, it is offered
// (COACH_HOSTED_ENABLED + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) and the user holds both the
// current coach (LOCAL) consent and the current HOSTED consent. Anything else
// quietly answers locally.
//
// A hosted call that fails before any text reached the user (network, 5xx,
// rate limit, or a refusal the server-side fallback could not rescue) is
// retried on the local model for that one message. runAnswer reads
// EngineSelection.servedBy (as AnswerDeps.servedEngine) before it stores the
// reply, so the stored engine, done.engine and telemetry all say 'local' and
// the app can say "answered by the on-device model". Once hosted text has been
// shown it cannot be taken back, and once the caller aborted (budget spent,
// user tapped stop) there is no one to answer, so neither case falls back.
//
// The fallback lives inside the provider, not around runAnswer: the pipeline
// runs once per message, so memory resolution, the status event and the stored
// reply each happen once, whichever model ends up answering.
