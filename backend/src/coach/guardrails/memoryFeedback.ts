// Next-message feedback detector for pending coach memory (spec section 6):
// a PENDING entry becomes CONFIRMED when the user's NEXT message does not
// correct or dismiss THAT FACT, and is deleted when it does. The design is
// "assume yes unless corrected about that fact".
//
// The rule is deterministic (no LLM) and evaluated per entry:
//
//   1. Explicit memory-directed dismissal ("forget that", "delete it", "don't
//      save that", "that's wrong", "you got it wrong", "never mind that") ->
//      'dismiss', whatever the entry says.
//   2. Topical correction: the message contains a correction cue (no, not,
//      actually, instead, meant, changed...) AND shares at least one content
//      word with the entry's value ("Actually it's a full marathon" against
//      "training for a half-marathon in March") -> 'dismiss'.
//   3. Everything else -> 'confirm'.
//
// The bias is deliberately toward CONFIRM, the reverse of an earlier version
// that deleted on any negation word anywhere ("why is my score not higher"
// deleted an unrelated memory). The two errors are not symmetric: a wrongly
// CONFIRMED memory is visible (Settings lists it, it can be edited or deleted,
// and only categorised non-health values can exist at all), whereas a wrongly
// DELETED one is silent and the user never knows it was lost. When a deletion
// does happen the orchestrator says so in the reply.
