# Social S2 — Campfire — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Ship build phase S2 of the Social tab: the camp banner opens a Campfire page (the scene of you and your
buddies around the fire, day/night, asleep/awake, fire strength, "Who's here"), "Say goodnight" (with a 10-minute
undo), camp notes (a short note in a speech bubble over its author's coach), and the camp's timeline kinds, story
frames and week-highlight items — plus the four items S1 deferred to S2 (one preloaded circle per Social read,
highlight retention and deleted-id purge, a Social refresh on a foreground buddy push, and two story-viewer fixes).

**Architecture:** Two new tables (`Goodnight`, `CampNote`) and one additive migration. The backend `social/` module
gains a pure clock module (`night.ts`), `goodnight.ts`, `campNotes.ts`, `camp.ts` (the `GET /me/camp` view and the
banner summary) and `sweep.ts`; every Social read now loads the viewer's circle ONCE (`loadCircle` in `circle.ts`:
buddies, members with their sharing switches, each member's check-in for their own today, and the last 48 h of
goodnights) and passes it to stories, timeline, highlights, the camp and `me`, so they all agree. Mobile adds the
camp API, a `GoodnightButton`, a `CampfireScreen` (pushed, no tab bar), new copy, and wires the banner, the evening
timeline, story frames and highlights.

**Tech Stack:** Express 5 + Prisma 6 (Postgres) + BullMQ backend (TypeScript, Jest + supertest); Expo 57 / React
Native app (NativeWind, React Navigation 7, Jest + React Native Testing Library).

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-social-tab-design.md` (§4 item 1, §4.2 `goodnight` frames, §5 goodnight
and camp-note timeline items, §6 Campfire page, §7 `campfire` / `top_story` on-time goodnights / `also` joined + first
badge, §9 privacy, §12 S2, §13 tests). Builds on the S1 plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-07-social-s1.md` (merged,
PR #53) and its ledger `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s1/progress.md`.

## Global Constraints

- **Scope = S2 only** (spec §12): goodnight, the Campfire scene, fire strength, camp notes, "Who's here", the camp's
  timeline kinds / story frame / highlight items, the banner opening the Campfire, and the S1 deferrals (a)–(d). No
  conversations, messages, reactions, Chats notes, reports, presence, Requests move or `dm_message` (S3). Until S3,
  "Message camp" opens the existing `Buddies` screen (as S1's Chats button does) and tapping a buddy's coach opens
  their week (`BuddyWeek`).
- **Workspace (Task 0):** backend tests run **only** through `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh <paths>`
  — a copy of the S1 helper (test DB from `~/dev/biometrics-run/backend/.env`, Redis db 1, `cd` into this worktree's
  `backend/`). **Never run two invocations at once.** Never point anything at the dev `biometrics` DB.
- Mobile tests, from `mobile/`: `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/jest --forceExit <paths>`.
- **Typecheck baselines:** backend `node node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` is clean; mobile
  `node node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit --types jest,node --pretty false | grep -c "error TS"` is **12** (the file list in
  `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s1/tsc-baseline.txt`). No task may add an error.
- **Commits:** plain `git commit -m "…"`, no `Co-Authored-By` trailer, no mention of Claude or AI. Never push.
- **Privacy (carried from S1 and spec §9):** a buddy's numbers only through `effectiveSharing` (switch on **and**
  current consent); badges only while the author effectively shares streaks; timeline, story frames and highlights
  carry no health numbers (counts of the circle's own actions — stickers, lit nights — are allowed); nothing about
  buddies reaches the AI coach; logs carry ids, event names and counts only (`JSON.stringify({ event, …ids })`).
  A goodnight and its on-time flag are self-reported and always shared with buddies, like the check-in (spec §6.4
  shows "asleep since 22:15 · on time" to the camp).
- **Camp notes are user free text (spec §9):** never logged — not even their length — never sent to the coach,
  never in a push, never in `/me/social`, the timeline, story frames or highlights. Only `GET /me/camp` returns note
  text, to the author and the author's **current** buddies. Unpair and block hide it at once (the circle is read
  live); account deletion removes it (FK cascade).
- **One circle per read (S1 ledger deferral a):** every Social read goes through `loadCircle(viewerId, now)` once and
  hands the `Circle` to every helper; no helper re-derives buddies, members, the viewer's day or the check-in lock.
- **Days and clocks:** a check-in and a story belong to the **author's** local day; the timeline is the **viewer's**
  local day; a goodnight belongs to its **evening** (`eveningDate`: one said 00:00–05:59 local belongs to the previous
  date); the scene's night/day follows the **viewer's** zone (night = 19:00–05:59: `isNight`, the stars, the banner's
  night line); the "Say goodnight" **button** has its own window in the **author's** zone, from
  `min(20:00, bedtime goal − 60 min)` (20:00 with no goal) to 05:59 (`isGoodnightOpen`); each member's "tonight"
  follows their **own** zone; a camp note clears at the next **06:00 in its author's zone**; a week is Monday–Sunday;
  a past night's fire is **frozen** — it counts the viewer and only the buddies paired with the viewer by that
  evening's 19:00 in the viewer's zone (`campOnEvening`, from `BuddyPair.createdAt` loaded with the circle).
- **Routes:** the Campfire routes are the spec's paths (§6.4): `GET /me/camp`, `POST|DELETE /me/camp/goodnight`,
  `PUT|DELETE /me/camp/note`, on `socialRouter`. GETs set `Cache-Control: private, no-store`. Errors use `BuddyError`
  / `buddyRoute`; every new code goes into `BUDDY_ERROR_STATUS` **and** gets its words in `mobile/src/lib/buddyCopy.ts`
  in the same task (`mobile/__tests__/lib/buddyCopy.test.ts` reads the backend codes and fails otherwise).
- **New tables** have no `userId` column: the owner column is `authorId`, the FK to `User` is `onDelete: Cascade`, and
  each model is registered in `backend/src/buddies/models.ts` (`SOCIAL_MODELS`, `SOCIAL_USER_COLUMNS`) and seeded in
  `backend/tests/buddies/deletion.test.ts`. Tests delete accounts through `deleteUserAccount`, never `prisma.user.delete`.
- **Migration:** one additive migration, `backend/prisma/migrations/20261010120000_social_campfire` (after
  `20261009130000`): CREATE TABLE / INDEX / FK only.
- **Older pieces keep working:** an S1 app on an S2 server already skips unknown timeline kinds, frame kinds,
  highlight types and top-story reasons (S1 `socialCopy` allow-lists); an S2 app on an S1 server sees no
  `camp.night` / `me.goodnight` (banner stays the static strip, no goodnight row) and a bare 404 from `GET /me/camp`
  ("The camp isn't open yet").
- **Plan rulings (where the spec is silent or loose; the owner may revert):**
  - Plan ruling: camp-note length is 1–40 Unicode code points after the display-name sanitiser (NFC; `Cc`, `Cf`,
    default-ignorable code points and line/paragraph separators removed — so no newlines; trimmed), with at least one
    visible character; no reserved-word check (spec §6.3). The app's counter counts code points of the trimmed draft.
  - Plan ruling: a camp note lives until the next 06:00 in its author's zone, or until its author's first check-in of
    a day at or after it — `saveCheckIn` deletes notes written at or before that day's first check-in, and reads hide
    them too — whichever is first. Expired rows are hidden at read time and deleted by the hourly social sweep.
  - Plan ruling: one note per author; Share replaces it (new text, new `createdAt`, new expiry); Clear deletes it.
    The share upsert sets `createdAt` to `now` on update too, on purpose: the clear-on-check-in rule compares the
    note's `createdAt` with the day's first check-in, so a replaced note must carry its own time.
  - Plan ruling (owner, Q3): a note keeps the rule above — it lasts until the next 06:00 or its author's first
    check-in, whichever is first.
  - Plan ruling: a note is visible to its author and the author's current buddies only, only on the Campfire page.
    Unpair or block hides it from that person at once (the row is the author's and still shows to their other
    buddies); account deletion deletes it.
  - Plan ruling: moderation in S2 = sanitise, trim, reject empty or invisible-only, cap at 40, and 20 shares per hour
    per author through the Buddies limiter, failing closed (`rate_limited` / `try_later`). Clearing your own note
    (`clearCampNote`, `DELETE /me/camp/note`) is never rate-limited and never fails closed: removing it always works.
    URLs and @handles are allowed in a note in S2 (no link or mention filter). Reporting a camp note is S3
    (`POST /me/reports`, spec §8.5/§9).
  - Plan ruling (owner, Q1): "Say goodnight" opens at `min(20:00, bedtime goal − 60 min)` in the author's zone (20:00
    with no goal; a goal before 12:00 counts as after midnight, so it opens at 20:00) and closes at 05:59;
    `goodnight_closed` (409) outside that window. The night scene (`isNight`, stars, the banner's night line) stays
    19:00–05:59; only the button's window moves. A second goodnight the same evening returns the first one unchanged;
    `DELETE` undoes only the goodnight of the current evening (`localDate = eveningDate(now)`, never yesterday's)
    within 10 minutes of its `at` (`undo_expired`, 409, after that; nothing to undo → 204). `onTime` is judged at
    minute resolution: at or before the bedtime goal + 15 min, or 23:00 with no goal; a goal before 12:00 counts as
    after midnight.
  - Plan ruling: goodnight copy — the button reads "Say goodnight"; once said, "Goodnight said" (", on time" when it
    was) with "Undo" for its 10 minutes; outside the window the Campfire shows "You can say goodnight from {h:mm a}"
    with the viewer's own opening time (e.g. "8:00 PM", "5:00 PM"), and a refused tap says "It's too early to say
    goodnight."; the evening timeline shows the same button under Today while the viewer's goodnight window is open
    (`camp.goodnightOpen` on `/me/social`). Every time on the Campfire is 12-hour ("asleep since 10:15 PM", the kicker
    "TUESDAY · 10:42 PM").
  - Plan ruling: asleep = a goodnight for the member's current evening, or for last evening between 06:00 and 11:59
    local until they check in (spec: "said goodnight tonight and not yet checked in today").
  - Plan ruling: the camp banner reads "THE CAMP" + "{awake} awake · {asleep} asleep" at night (spec §4 item 1) and
    "{n} checked in" by day (S1); it opens the Campfire only when the server sends `camp.night` (an S2 server).
  - Plan ruling: `GET /me/camp` members carry `person` (the S1 DTO idiom) plus `mine`, `asleep`, `asleepSince`,
    `onTime`, `note` — instead of the spec's flat `id / displayName / coachId` — and the body adds `goodnight` (mine
    tonight, for Undo) and `goodnightOpen` / `goodnightOpensAt` (my own window, "HH:MM" local). Members are me first,
    then buddies by latest activity (check-in, goodnight or note); the app seats the first 8 around the fire (a fixed,
    tested layout with no overlap in the 340-px scene) and shows "+N" for the rest; "Who's here" lists everyone.
  - Plan ruling (owner, Q4): the bubble over a coach is one truncated line; the "Who's here" row shows the full note
    (no line limit).
  - Plan ruling: the fire card copy is "The fire grows as your circle gets to bed by their goal. Keep it lit." (the
    canvas' camp-badge promise is dropped, spec §6.2) plus "Nights lit this week: N".
  - Plan ruling (owner, Q2): tonight's fire is live (the current camp). "Nights lit this week" and the `campfire`
    highlight count each night with that night's camp: the viewer, plus the buddies whose `BuddyPair.createdAt` is at
    or before that evening's 19:00 in the viewer's zone; only their on-time goodnights count. Pairing today never
    unlights Monday.
  - Plan ruling: timeline `goodnight` items ("Sam said goodnight, on time") for everyone, no one-tap action;
    `camp_note` items ("Ben left a camp note", never the text) only for a live note written during its author's night
    (19:00–05:59 author-local) — the spec's "(night only)".
  - Plan ruling: a story's `goodnight` frame belongs to the author's local date of its `at` (a 00:30 goodnight opens
    the new day's story); it is never locked.
  - Plan ruling: highlights — `top_story` reason `on_time_every_night` (7 on-time goodnights, no streak gate),
    `campfire` (lit nights ≥ 2; "The fire was lit N nights"), `joined` (a buddy who paired with the viewer that week),
    `first_badge` (a member's first-ever badge earned that week; gated by streaks like every badge; not repeated when
    that person's badge is the top story); `joined` and `first_badge` capped at 3 each. Weeks cached before S2 keep
    their S1 items.
  - Plan ruling (amends S1's "never persist an empty week"): a week with no candidates is rebuilt on every read only
    until 24 h after it turned final (`highlightsReadyAt + 24 h`); from then on it is cached empty, so a quiet circle
    stops paying the ~6 build queries on every read.
  - Plan ruling: retention — `runSocialSweep` deletes week-highlight caches whose `weekStart` is more than 4 weeks old
    and expired camp notes; it runs on the existing hourly recap-sweep tick (no new scheduler), whose job may pin the
    sweep's clock with `data.now` (tests only; no test runs the sweep on the real clock). Account deletion
    deletes every highlight cache whose JSON names the user (`purgeSocialJsonMentions`, registered with the social
    tables in `buddies/models.ts`); reads keep gating every cached actor against the live circle.
  - Plan ruling: a buddy push that arrives while the app is open refreshes the Social store, only once the store has
    loaded (idle = signed out or not started).
  - Plan ruling: my own story opens with a `mine: true` route param, so it never shows reply stickers while the
    Social home is still loading; a story with no frames says "Nothing in this story yet." (not "anymore"), and the
    gone view keeps "This story isn't available anymore." for `not_buddies` / bare 404.

## Review Focus

1. **Midnight, sunrise and zones:** a goodnight at 00:30 belongs to the evening before; a coach is asleep by its
   owner's clock (an Auckland buddy's 18:30 is not night while it is 22:30 in Los Angeles); Ana (Auckland) says
   goodnight at her 22:00 NZDT (2026-10-08T09:00Z): at my Los Angeles 02:30 (night) she is asleep with `onTime`
   judged by her own goal, at my 13:00 (her 09:00) she is still asleep, and at my 16:00 (her noon) she is awake; at my
   05:30 the camp is still `night: true` while her tonight is already the next evening; a note posted at 22:30 in
   Los Angeles clears at 06:00 Los Angeles time, on a DST change too. Tests: Task 2 (clock), Task 4 (goodnight),
   Task 6 (camp), Task 7 (story frame).
2. **Unpair, block or account deletion during the evening:** the ex-buddy's coach, bubble, goodnight and camp-note
   timeline item vanish on the next read both ways; deletion removes their `Goodnight`/`CampNote` rows and every
   highlight cache naming them; a buddy paired today never changes a past night's fire. Tests: Task 6, Task 7,
   Task 9, Task 10.
3. **Hostile or odd note text:** whitespace only, zero-width characters, newlines, 41 code points, 40 emoji, a
   reserved word — trimmed/sanitised/refused as the sanitiser says, and the text never reaches a log line, `/me/social`
   or the timeline. Tests: Task 5, Task 7, Task 8.
4. **Goodnight edges:** with no goal 19:30 is closed (though the scene is night) and 20:00 open; an 18:00 goal opens
   at 17:00 and 18:05 is on time; a 23:00 goal opens at 20:00; 05:59 is open and 06:00 closed; a second tap keeps the
   first; undo at exactly 10 minutes works and one millisecond later is `undo_expired`; undo after 06:00 never
   removes last night's goodnight; a check-in in the morning wakes the coach, noon does too. Tests: Task 2, Task 4,
   Task 6.
5. **Old server / new app and the reverse:** no `camp.night` → static banner and no goodnight row; `GET /me/camp` bare
   404 → "not open yet"; a goodnight frame without `onTime` and an unknown highlight value are skipped. Tests: Task 11,
   Task 12, Task 13.

## File Structure

Backend (`backend/`):
- Create `prisma/migrations/20261010120000_social_campfire/migration.sql` — `Goodnight`, `CampNote`, a
  `WeeklyHighlights(weekStart)` index.
- Modify `prisma/schema.prisma` — the two models, `User` back-relations, the index.
- Modify `src/buddies/models.ts` — registry entries; `purgeSocialJsonMentions` (JSON-held ids).
- Modify `src/buddies/errors.ts` — `goodnight_closed`, `undo_expired`, `invalid_note`.
- Modify `src/buddies/identity.ts` — export `hasVisibleCharacter`.
- Modify `src/lib/rateLimit.ts` — `RATE_LIMITS.campNote`.
- Create `src/social/night.ts` — pure clock: night scene, goodnight window, evening date, on-time, next sunrise, fire
  segments, each evening's camp, lit nights.
- Modify `src/social/circle.ts` — `Circle` (with `pairedAt` and `viewerBedtimeGoal`), `loadCircle`, `buddyPairsOf`,
  `todayCheckInsOf`, `recentGoodnightsOf`, `GoodnightRow`.
- Modify `src/social/checkins.ts` — export `toCheckInDTO`; a check-in clears older camp notes.
- Modify `src/social/stories.ts`, `src/social/timeline.ts`, `src/social/highlights.ts`, `src/social/home.ts` — take the
  circle; goodnight frames; goodnight / camp-note items; S2 highlight items; banner summary and `me.goodnight`.
- Create `src/social/goodnight.ts` — say / undo goodnight.
- Create `src/social/campNotes.ts` — validate, share, clear, `noteIsLive`.
- Create `src/social/camp.ts` — `sleepStates`, `campSummaryFor`, `getCamp`.
- Create `src/social/sweep.ts` — `runSocialSweep`.
- Modify `src/social/routes.ts` — the five camp routes.

- Tests: create `tests/social/{helpers,campfireSchema,night,homeQueries,goodnight,campNotes,camp,campTimeline,homeCamp,highlightsCamp,retention}.test.ts`
  (`helpers.ts` is not a test); modify `tests/buddies/deletion.test.ts`, `tests/social/home.test.ts`,
  `tests/social/highlights.test.ts` (one S1 test's clock, Task 3), `tests/recap/worker.test.ts` (mocks the social
  sweep, Task 10), `tests/scripts/seedSocial.test.ts`.

Mobile (`mobile/`):
- Modify `src/api/social.ts` — S2 types; `fetchCamp`, `sayGoodnight`, `undoGoodnight`, `saveCampNote`, `clearCampNote`.

- Modify `src/lib/buddyCopy.ts` — the three new error messages.
- Modify `src/components/social/TimelineList.tsx` (dot colours), `CampBanner.tsx` (night line, opens the camp),
  `SocialStoryFrame.tsx` (goodnight frame).
- Create `src/components/social/GoodnightButton.tsx`, `src/screens/CampfireScreen.tsx`.
- Modify `src/screens/SocialScreen.tsx`, `src/screens/SocialStoryScreen.tsx`, `src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`,

### Task 0: S2 workspace

**Files:** none in git (`.superpowers/` is ignored).

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh` — every later backend step runs it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Copy the S1 test helper into the S2 workspace**

```bash
mkdir -p .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire
cp .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s1/backend-jest.sh .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh
grep -n "^cd " .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh
```

Expected: `cd /Users/tushar/Documents/PROJECTS/Biometrics/.claude/worktrees/social-tab/backend` (the same worktree, so
the copy needs no edit).

- [ ] **Step 2: Check dependencies**

Run: `ls backend/node_modules/.bin/prisma mobile/node_modules/.bin/jest`
Expected: both paths print. If either is missing, run `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH npm ci`
in that folder, and in `backend/` also `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://placeholder@localhost:5432/placeholder npx prisma generate`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Confirm the baselines**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social` — Expected: PASS.
Run (from `mobile/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit --types jest,node --pretty false | grep -c "error TS"`
— Expected: `12`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Start the ledger**

Write `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/progress.md` with the plan path, the branch
(`feature/social-campfire`, base `b3cd4cf`) and the two baselines. Nothing to commit.

### Task 1: Campfire tables and migration

**Files:**
- Modify: `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (two models; `User` back-relations; `WeeklyHighlights` index)
- Create: `backend/prisma/migrations/20261010120000_social_campfire/migration.sql`
- Modify: `backend/src/buddies/models.ts`
- Test: create `backend/tests/social/campfireSchema.test.ts`; modify `backend/tests/buddies/deletion.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `deleteUserAccount(userId, deps)` (`src/users/deletion.ts`); `buddyUser()` (`tests/buddies/helpers.ts`).
- Produces: Prisma models `Goodnight { id, authorId, localDate @db.Date, at, onTime }` (unique `authorId_localDate`)
  and `CampNote { authorId @id, text, createdAt, expiresAt }`; registry entries `Goodnight: ['authorId']`,
  `CampNote: ['authorId']`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`backend/tests/social/campfireSchema.test.ts`:

```ts

are registered. In `seedSocial(a, b)`, inside the existing `for (const [me, other] of [[a, b], [b, a]] as const)`
loop, append after the `weeklyHighlights.create` line:

```ts

### Task 2: The camp's clock (pure)

**Files:**
- Create: `backend/src/social/night.ts`
- Test: `backend/tests/social/night.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `isValidTimeZone`, `localCivilDateOrUtc`, `localClockTime` (`src/biometrics/civilDate.ts`);
  `localHourOrUtc` (`src/recap/periods.ts`); `shiftDate` (`src/scoring/dates.ts`).
- Produces (`night.ts`): `NIGHT_START_HOUR = 19`, `SUNRISE_HOUR = 6`, `NOON_HOUR = 12`,
  `GOODNIGHT_OPEN_MINUTES = 1200` (20:00), `GOODNIGHT_LEAD_MINUTES = 60`, `FIRE_SEGMENTS = 5`, `LIT_NIGHT_SEGMENTS = 3`,
  `zoneOrUtc(tz): string`, `isNight(at: Date, tz): boolean` (the scene, 19:00–05:59),
  `goodnightOpensAt(bedtimeGoal: string | null): string` ("HH:MM", `min(20:00, goal − 60 min)`),
  `isGoodnightOpen(at: Date, tz, bedtimeGoal: string | null): boolean` (the button, opening time–05:59),
  `eveningDate(at: Date, tz): string` (YYYY-MM-DD), `isOnTime(at: Date, tz, bedtimeGoal: string | null): boolean`,
  `localInstant(date: string, hhmm: string, tz): Date`, `nextSunrise(now: Date, tz): Date`,
  `fireSegments(lit: number, of: number): number`,
  `campOnEvening(date: string, viewerId: string, pairedAt: ReadonlyMap<string, Date>, tz): Set<string>`,

### Task 3: One preloaded circle per Social read (S1 deferral a)

**Files:**
- Modify: `backend/src/social/circle.ts`, `backend/src/social/stories.ts`, `backend/src/social/timeline.ts`,
  `backend/src/social/highlights.ts`, `backend/src/social/home.ts`, `backend/src/social/checkins.ts`
- Test: create `backend/tests/social/homeQueries.test.ts`; modify one S1 test in `backend/tests/social/highlights.test.ts`
  (its clock only, for the owner's empty-week ruling); every other S1 suite `tests/social/{stories,timeline,highlights,home,checkins}.test.ts`
  must stay green unchanged, and no S1 DTO changes shape

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the `Goodnight` model (Task 1); S1 `buddyIdsOf`, `membersById`, `Member`, `MEMBER_SELECT`, `toPerson`,
  `effectiveSharing`; S1 `highlightsReadyAt`, `buildHighlightCandidates(viewerId, memberIds, weekStart)` (unchanged here).
- Produces (`circle.ts`):
  - `interface TodayCheckIn { authorId: string; mood: CheckInMood; localDate: Date; createdAt: Date; updatedAt: Date }`
  - `interface GoodnightRow { id: string; authorId: string; localDate: Date; at: Date; onTime: boolean }`,
    `GOODNIGHT_SELECT`, `RECENT_GOODNIGHT_MS = 48 h`
  - `interface Circle { viewer: Member; viewerBedtimeGoal: string | null; buddies: Member[]; members: Map<string, Member>; pairedAt: Map<string, Date>; today: string; checkIns: Map<string, TodayCheckIn>; goodnights: GoodnightRow[] }`
    (`members` = viewer + buddies; `pairedAt` = each current buddy's `BuddyPair.createdAt` (owner ruling Q2: Tasks 6
    and 9 freeze past nights with it); `viewerBedtimeGoal` = the viewer's own goal, for the goodnight window (Tasks 6
    and 8) — buddies' goals are never kept; `checkIns` = each member's check-in for their OWN local today;
    `goodnights` = the members' goodnights with `at` in the last 48 h)
  - `buddyPairsOf(userId): Promise<Map<string, Date>>` (buddy id → pair `createdAt`; `buddyIdsOf` = its keys),
    `loadCircle(viewerId, now): Promise<Circle>` (4 queries; a missing viewer → `BuddyError('not_buddies')`),
    `todayCheckInsOf(members: Member[], now): Promise<Map<string, TodayCheckIn>>`, `recentGoodnightsOf(ids: string[], now): Promise<GoodnightRow[]>`.
- Produces (helpers that take the circle; the S1 names stay as thin wrappers so S1 tests and routes keep working):
  - `stories.ts`: `interface StoryRings { rings; checkedInBuddies; viewerCheckedIn; checkedInCoachIds }`,
    `storyRingsFor(circle, now): Promise<StoryRings>`; `loadStoryRings(viewerId, now)` = `storyRingsFor(await loadCircle(…))`;
    `getStory` reads the circle.
  - `timeline.ts`: `timelineFor(circle, now, limit = 100)`; `buildTimeline(viewerId, now, limit)` wraps it.
  - `highlights.ts`: `highlightsWeekFor(timeZone, now): string`, `weeklyHighlightsFor(circle, now)`;
    `getWeeklyHighlights(viewerId, now)` wraps it. `highlightsWeek(viewerId, now)` is removed: its only caller was
    `getWeeklyHighlights` (`highlights.ts:137`), which now uses `highlightsWeekFor`. `EMPTY_WEEK_SETTLE_MS = 24 h`: a
    week with no candidates is cached empty once `now ≥ highlightsReadyAt(week) + 24 h` (owner ruling, amending S1's
    "never persist an empty week"); before that it is rebuilt on every read.
  - `checkins.ts`: `toCheckInDTO(row: { mood; localDate; updatedAt }): CheckInDTO` (exported; was the private `toDTO`).
  - `home.ts`: `getSocialHome` and `markStickersSeen` load the circle once.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

// carries when each buddy paired with the viewer (a past night's fire counts only buddies paired by that evening) and
// the viewer's own bedtime goal (the goodnight window); buddies' bedtime goals are never kept.

```ts
export const toCheckInDTO = (row: { mood: CheckInMood; localDate: Date; updatedAt: Date }): CheckInDTO => ({

// and recaps they shared today (the headline line snapshotted when they shared it, period and coach — never the
// stats JSON, never the live Recap.line). Built at read time from the preloaded circle (whose check-ins also decide
// the lock) plus one query per remaining source. Rings: unseen first, then newest (plan ruling).

- [ ] **Step 6: The timeline reads the circle**

Replace `backend/src/social/timeline.ts` with:

```ts
// Today timeline (spec 2026-10-07 social §5): your circle's events whose moment falls in the VIEWER's local today,
// oldest first. Closed kinds with typed fields (the app renders the copy) — never free text, never a health number.
// Step goals only while the author shares steps; badges only while they share streaks (both via effectiveSharing).
// A buddy's check-in is LOCKED (no mood) until the viewer has checked in for their own local today — the same lock
// as story frames (spec §4.1), read from the same preloaded circle; the viewer's own check-in is never locked.
// Badges follow the story frames' rule (todaysTopBadges): no backfilled old runs, one item per multi-level jump.

  return items.slice(-limit);
}

export async function buildTimeline(viewerId: string, now: Date, limit = 100): Promise<TimelineItemDTO[]> {
  if (limit <= 0) return [];
  return timelineFor(await loadCircle(viewerId, now), now, limit);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Highlights read the circle**

In `backend/src/social/highlights.ts`, replace the header comment's lines 5–6

```ts
// drops out, and a badge item needs its actor to share streaks now (the viewer is exempt). A build with no
// candidates is never stored, so a quiet week is rebuilt on the next read. Closed item types, no health numbers:
```

with

```ts
// drops out, and a badge item needs its actor to share streaks now (the viewer is exempt). A build with no
// candidates is rebuilt on every read for the first 24 h after the week turns final (late check-ins still land),
// then cached empty, so a quiet circle stops paying the build queries on every read (S2 owner ruling; S1 never
// stored an empty week). Closed item types, no health numbers:
```

Replace the import block (from
`import type { AchievementFamily …` through `import { buddyIdsOf, membersById, type Member } from './circle';`) with:

```ts
import type { AchievementFamily, CheckInMood, Prisma } from '@prisma/client';
import { civilDateToUtcMidnight, localCivilDateOrUtc } from '../biometrics/civilDate';
import { prisma } from '../db/client';
import type { PersonDTO } from '../buddies/people';
import { lastCompletedPeriodStart } from '../recap/periods';
import { shiftDate } from '../scoring/dates';
import { loadCircle, type Circle, type Member } from './circle';
```

Replace the whole `highlightsWeek` function (its doc comment included; its only caller was `getWeeklyHighlights`,
`highlights.ts:137`, which is replaced below) with:

```ts
/** A quiet week is rebuilt on each read for this long after it turns final, then cached empty. */
export const EMPTY_WEEK_SETTLE_MS = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

/** The newest week that is final for a viewer in `timeZone`: their last completed week, or the one before it until Monday 14:00 UTC. */
export function highlightsWeekFor(timeZone: string, now: Date): string {
  const latest = lastCompletedPeriodStart('WEEK', localCivilDateOrUtc(now, timeZone));
  return now.getTime() >= highlightsReadyAt(latest).getTime() ? latest : shiftDate(latest, -7);
}
```

Replace the whole `getWeeklyHighlights` function with:

```ts
export async function weeklyHighlightsFor(circle: Circle, now: Date): Promise<HighlightsDTO | null> {
  const viewerId = circle.viewer.person.id;
  const weekStart = highlightsWeekFor(circle.viewer.timezone, now);
  const memberIds = [viewerId, ...circle.buddies.map((b) => b.person.id)];
  const key = { viewerId_weekStart: { viewerId, weekStart: civilDateToUtcMidnight(weekStart) } };
  let row = await prisma.weeklyHighlights.findUnique({ where: key, select: { items: true } });
  if (!row) {
    const candidates = await buildHighlightCandidates(viewerId, memberIds, weekStart);
    // A quiet week is rebuilt on each read for its first 24 h as final (late rows still land), then cached empty so
    // later reads cost one query instead of the whole build.
    const settled = now.getTime() >= highlightsReadyAt(weekStart).getTime() + EMPTY_WEEK_SETTLE_MS;
    if (candidates.length === 0 && !settled) return null;
    await prisma.weeklyHighlights.createMany({
      data: [{ viewerId, weekStart: civilDateToUtcMidnight(weekStart), items: candidates as unknown as Prisma.InputJsonValue }],
      skipDuplicates: true,
    });
    row = await prisma.weeklyHighlights.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: key, select: { items: true } });
  }
  const items = visibleItems(row.items as unknown as HighlightItem[], viewerId, circle.members);
  return items.length > 0 ? { weekStart, weekEnd: shiftDate(weekStart, 6), items } : null;
}

export async function getWeeklyHighlights(viewerId: string, now: Date): Promise<HighlightsDTO | null> {
  return weeklyHighlightsFor(await loadCircle(viewerId, now), now);
}
```

(`visibleItems` keeps its `members: Map<string, Member>` parameter; `buildHighlightCandidates` is unchanged here —
Task 9 changes it to take the circle.)

In `backend/tests/social/highlights.test.ts` (S1), the comeback test read at `NOW`, which is now more than 24 h after
week 2026-09-28 turned final, so its quiet first read would be cached. Move that test's two reads into the first day
(this is the only S1 test edit in S2). Replace the whole test
`it('a comeback needs consecutive days, and a week with nothing is never stored', …)` with:

```ts
it('a comeback needs consecutive days, and a week with nothing is not stored in its first day as final', async () => {
  const me = await buddyUser();
  const zed = await buddyUser({ displayName: 'Zed' });
  await pairUp(me.id, zed.id);
  // Tue 2026-10-06 10:00 UTC: the week turned final at Mon 14:00 UTC, and an empty build is cached only from Tue 14:00.
  const firstDay = new Date('2026-10-06T10:00:00Z');
  // Tired Mon, Tired Tue, nothing Wed, Rested Thu: not a comeback.
  await prisma.checkIn.create({ data: { authorId: zed.id, localDate: day(0), mood: 'TIRED' } });
  await prisma.checkIn.create({ data: { authorId: zed.id, localDate: day(1), mood: 'TIRED' } });
  await prisma.checkIn.create({ data: { authorId: zed.id, localDate: day(3), mood: 'RESTED' } });
  expect(await getWeeklyHighlights(me.id, firstDay)).toBeNull();
  expect(await prisma.weeklyHighlights.count({ where: { viewerId: me.id } })).toBe(0);
  // Rebuilt on the next read: a late check-in that completes the run now counts.
  await prisma.checkIn.create({ data: { authorId: zed.id, localDate: day(2), mood: 'TIRED' } });
  expect((await getWeeklyHighlights(me.id, firstDay))!.items.map((i) => i.type)).toEqual(['comeback']);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 8: The home loads the circle once**

Replace `backend/src/social/home.ts` with:

```ts
// The Social home in one call (spec 2026-10-07 social §4). One preloaded circle feeds every part (rings, timeline,
// highlights, `me`), so they agree on buddies, switches and the check-in lock. The camp banner: who in your circle
// checked in today, plus up to two of their coach faces. Unread counts feed the Social tab's dot: incoming buddy
// requests and unseen stickers from current buddies sent in the viewer's local today (chats join in S3) — the same
// window as the today timeline, so it counts only stickers Social shows. Those are marked seen by the Social screen
// once it has shown them (POST /me/social/stickers/seen), so the dot clears where the cause is read. Older unseen
// stickers stay unseen and keep their Buddies-side "new" marker until that buddy's week is opened.

import { localCivilDateOrUtc } from '../biometrics/civilDate';
import { prisma } from '../db/client';
import { countRequests } from '../buddies/requests';
import type { PersonDTO } from '../buddies/people';

import { weeklyHighlightsFor, type HighlightsDTO } from './highlights';
import { storyRingsFor, type StoryRingDTO } from './stories';
import { timelineFor, TODAY_WINDOW_MS, type TimelineItemDTO } from './timeline';

export interface SocialHomeDTO {
  me: { person: PersonDTO; checkIn: CheckInDTO | null };
  camp: { checkedIn: number; members: number; faces: string[] };
  stories: StoryRingDTO[];
  highlights: HighlightsDTO | null;
  timeline: TimelineItemDTO[];
  unread: { requests: number; stickers: number };
}

/** Ids of the unseen stickers to the viewer from current buddies whose moment falls in the viewer's local today. */
async function unseenTodayStickerIds(circle: Circle, now: Date): Promise<string[]> {
  const buddyIds = circle.buddies.map((b) => b.person.id);
  if (buddyIds.length === 0) return [];
  const rows = await prisma.sticker.findMany({
    where: { toUserId: circle.viewer.person.id, seenAt: null, fromUserId: { in: buddyIds }, sentAt: { gte: new Date(now.getTime() - TODAY_WINDOW_MS) } },
    select: { id: true, sentAt: true },
  });
  return rows.filter((s) => localCivilDateOrUtc(s.sentAt, circle.viewer.timezone) === circle.today).map((s) => s.id);
}

export async function getSocialHome(viewerId: string, now: Date): Promise<SocialHomeDTO> {
  const circle = await loadCircle(viewerId, now);
  const [rings, timeline, highlights, requests, stickers] = await Promise.all([
    storyRingsFor(circle, now),
    timelineFor(circle, now),
    weeklyHighlightsFor(circle, now),
    countRequests(viewerId, now),
    unseenTodayStickerIds(circle, now),
  ]);
  const mine = circle.checkIns.get(viewerId);
  return {
    me: { person: circle.viewer.person, checkIn: mine ? toCheckInDTO(mine) : null },
    camp: {
      checkedIn: rings.checkedInBuddies + (rings.viewerCheckedIn ? 1 : 0),
      members: circle.members.size,
      faces: rings.checkedInCoachIds,
    },
    stories: rings.rings,
    highlights,
    timeline,
    unread: { requests: requests.incoming, stickers: stickers.length },
  };
}

  const result = await prisma.sticker.updateMany({ where: { id: { in: ids }, seenAt: null }, data: { seenAt: now } });

}
```

- [ ] **Step 9: Run the new test and every S1 social suite**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social`
Expected: PASS (including `homeQueries.test.ts`; the S1 suites unchanged apart from the comeback test's clock above).
Run: `git diff --stat b3cd4cf -- backend/tests/social` — Expected: only `highlights.test.ts` among the S1 files.
Run (from `backend/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` — Expected: no output.

- [ ] **Step 10: Commit**

```bash
git add backend/src/social backend/tests/social/homeQueries.test.ts backend/tests/social/highlights.test.ts
git commit -m "refactor(social): load the circle once per read and share it across rings, timeline, highlights and me"
```

### Task 4: Say goodnight, with undo

**Files:**
- Create: `backend/src/social/goodnight.ts`, `backend/tests/social/helpers.ts`
- Modify: `backend/src/buddies/errors.ts`, `backend/src/social/routes.ts`, `mobile/src/lib/buddyCopy.ts`
- Test: `backend/tests/social/goodnight.test.ts`; rerun `mobile/__tests__/lib/buddyCopy.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `eveningDate`, `isGoodnightOpen`, `isOnTime`, `zoneOrUtc` (Task 2); `GOODNIGHT_SELECT`, `GoodnightRow`
  (Task 3).
- Produces:
  - `goodnight.ts`: `GOODNIGHT_UNDO_MS = 600_000`, `interface GoodnightDTO { localDate: string; at: string; onTime: boolean; undoUntil: string }`,
    `toGoodnightDTO(row: Pick<GoodnightRow, 'localDate' | 'at' | 'onTime'>): GoodnightDTO`,
    `sayGoodnight(userId, now): Promise<GoodnightDTO>` (open from `min(20:00, goal − 60 min)` to 05:59 in the
    author's zone), `undoGoodnight(userId, now): Promise<void>` (only the goodnight whose `localDate` is
    `eveningDate(now)`; never yesterday's).
  - Error codes `goodnight_closed: 409`, `undo_expired: 409` (and their mobile words: "It's too early to say
    goodnight." / "It's too late to undo that goodnight.").
  - Routes `POST /me/camp/goodnight` → `{ goodnight: GoodnightDTO }`; `DELETE /me/camp/goodnight` → 204.
  - `tests/social/helpers.ts`: `zoneAtLocalHour(hour: number, now?: Date): string`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test helper and the failing test**

`backend/tests/social/helpers.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * An IANA zone where it is `hour`:xx right now, for route tests that read the real clock. Etc/GMT zones have
 * inverted signs: Etc/GMT-3 is UTC+3. Pick a middle-of-the-window hour (22 for night, 12 for day), so a test that
 * crosses an hour boundary still lands in the same window.
 */
export function zoneAtLocalHour(hour: number, now: Date = new Date()): string {
  const ahead = (((hour - now.getUTCHours()) % 24) + 24) % 24; // hours ahead of UTC, 0..23

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to see it fail**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social/goodnight.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — "Cannot find module '../../src/social/goodnight'".

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the error codes and their words**

In `backend/src/buddies/errors.ts`, after `recap_not_found: 404,` add:

```ts
  goodnight_closed: 409,
  undo_expired: 409,
```

In `mobile/src/lib/buddyCopy.ts`, in the `ERRORS` table after `recap_not_found: "That recap can't be shared.",` add:

```ts
  goodnight_closed: "It's too early to say goodnight.",
  undo_expired: "It's too late to undo that goodnight.",
```

(The Campfire itself names the viewer's own opening time — "You can say goodnight from 8:00 PM" — from
`GET /me/camp`, Task 13; this table has no time to show.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Write `goodnight.ts`**

`backend/src/social/goodnight.ts`:

```ts
// "Say goodnight" (spec 2026-10-07 social §6.1): one Goodnight per author per evening (one said between 00:00 and
// 05:59 local belongs to the previous date), open from min(20:00, bedtime goal − 60 min) to 05:59 in the author's
// zone (owner ruling Q1; the night scene keeps 19:00), on time when it is at or before the bedtime goal + 15 min
// (23:00 with no goal), undoable for 10 minutes — only tonight's, never last night's. Always shared with buddies,
// like the check-in: self-reported, no number. No push (spec §10).

import { civilDateToUtcMidnight } from '../biometrics/civilDate';
import { prisma } from '../db/client';
import { BuddyError } from '../buddies/errors';
import { GOODNIGHT_SELECT, type GoodnightRow } from './circle';
import { eveningDate, isGoodnightOpen, isOnTime, zoneOrUtc } from './night';

export const GOODNIGHT_UNDO_MS = 10 * 60 * 1000;

export interface GoodnightDTO { localDate: string; at: string; onTime: boolean; undoUntil: string }

export function toGoodnightDTO(row: Pick<GoodnightRow, 'localDate' | 'at' | 'onTime'>): GoodnightDTO {
  return {
    localDate: row.localDate.toISOString().slice(0, 10),
    at: row.at.toISOString(),
    onTime: row.onTime,
    undoUntil: new Date(row.at.getTime() + GOODNIGHT_UNDO_MS).toISOString(),
  };
}

export async function sayGoodnight(userId: string, now: Date): Promise<GoodnightDTO> {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId }, select: { timezone: true, bedtimeGoal: true } });
  if (!user) throw new BuddyError('not_buddies');
  const zone = zoneOrUtc(user.timezone);
  if (!isGoodnightOpen(now, zone, user.bedtimeGoal)) throw new BuddyError('goodnight_closed');
  const localDate = civilDateToUtcMidnight(eveningDate(now, zone));
  // A second tap the same evening keeps the first goodnight: its time and its on-time verdict.
  await prisma.goodnight.createMany({
    data: [{ authorId: userId, localDate, at: now, onTime: isOnTime(now, zone, user.bedtimeGoal) }],
    skipDuplicates: true,
  });
  const row = await prisma.goodnight.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { authorId_localDate: { authorId: userId, localDate } }, select: GOODNIGHT_SELECT });
  return toGoodnightDTO(row);
}

/**
 * Undoes my goodnight for the current evening (localDate = eveningDate(now)) within 10 minutes of it; later →
 * undo_expired. Never yesterday's: after 06:00 the evening has moved on, so last night's goodnight is not undone
 * even inside its 10 minutes. None for this evening → nothing to do.
 */
export async function undoGoodnight(userId: string, now: Date): Promise<void> {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId }, select: { timezone: true } });
  if (!user) return;
  const localDate = civilDateToUtcMidnight(eveningDate(now, zoneOrUtc(user.timezone)));
  const tonight = await prisma.goodnight.findUnique({
    where: { authorId_localDate: { authorId: userId, localDate } },
    select: { id: true, at: true },
  });
  if (!tonight) return;
  if (now.getTime() - tonight.at.getTime() > GOODNIGHT_UNDO_MS) throw new BuddyError('undo_expired');
  await prisma.goodnight.deleteMany({ where: { id: tonight.id } });
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Add the routes**

In `backend/src/social/routes.ts`, replace the header's two comment lines with:

```ts
// Social tab routes (spec 2026-10-07 social). Every path is /me/social… or the Campfire's /me/camp… (spec §6.4), so
// nothing collides with the Buddies `/me/buddies/:buddyId` routes. GETs are never cached.
```

add `import { sayGoodnight, undoGoodnight } from './goodnight';` to the imports, and append:

```ts
socialRouter.post('/me/camp/goodnight', requireAuth, buddyRoute(async (req, res) => {
  res.json({ goodnight: await sayGoodnight(req.userId!, new Date()) });
}));

socialRouter.delete('/me/camp/goodnight', requireAuth, buddyRoute(async (req, res) => {
  await undoGoodnight(req.userId!, new Date());
  res.status(204).end();
}));
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social/goodnight.test.ts`
Expected: PASS.
Run (from `mobile/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/jest --forceExit __tests__/lib/buddyCopy.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (every server code has words).

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add backend/src/social/goodnight.ts backend/src/social/routes.ts backend/src/buddies/errors.ts backend/tests/social/helpers.ts backend/tests/social/goodnight.test.ts mobile/src/lib/buddyCopy.ts
git commit -m "feat(social): say goodnight from 20:00 or an hour before the goal, judged on time, with a 10-minute undo"
```

### Task 5: Camp notes — share, clear, expire, cleared by a check-in

**Files:**
- Create: `backend/src/social/campNotes.ts`
- Modify: `backend/src/buddies/identity.ts` (export `hasVisibleCharacter`), `backend/src/lib/rateLimit.ts`,
  `backend/src/buddies/errors.ts`, `backend/src/social/checkins.ts`, `backend/src/social/routes.ts`,
  `mobile/src/lib/buddyCopy.ts`
- Test: `backend/tests/social/campNotes.test.ts`; rerun `backend/tests/social/checkins.test.ts`, `backend/tests/buddies/identity.test.ts`, `mobile/__tests__/lib/buddyCopy.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `sanitiseDisplayName` (`src/buddies/identity.ts`); `limitOrThrow`, `BuddyError` (`src/buddies/errors.ts`);
  `nextSunrise` (Task 2); `Circle` (Task 3).
- Produces:
  - `campNotes.ts`: `CAMP_NOTE_MAX = 40`, `interface CampNoteDTO { text: string; createdAt: string; expiresAt: string }`,
    `checkCampNote(raw: unknown): string | null`, `noteIsLive(note: { authorId: string; createdAt: Date; expiresAt: Date }, circle: Circle, now: Date): boolean`,
    `shareCampNote(userId, raw: unknown, now): Promise<CampNoteDTO>` (rate-limited, fails closed; the upsert sets
    `createdAt = now` on replace too, on purpose), `clearCampNote(userId): Promise<void>` (never rate-limited, never
    fails closed: removing your own note always works).
  - `RATE_LIMITS.campNote = { name: 'camp_note', limit: 20, windowSeconds: 3600 }` — spent by shares only.
  - Error code `invalid_note: 400` (mobile words: "Notes are 1 to 40 characters.").
  - `saveCheckIn` also deletes the author's camp notes written at or before that day's first check-in.
  - Routes `PUT /me/camp/note { text }` → `{ note: CampNoteDTO }`; `DELETE /me/camp/note` → 204.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to see it fail**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social/campNotes.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — "Cannot find module '../../src/social/campNotes'".

- [ ] **Step 3: The shared pieces**

`backend/src/buddies/identity.ts` — export the visible-character check (no other change):

```ts
/** At least one letter, number, symbol or punctuation mark; the braille blank (U+2800, a symbol) does not count. */
export function hasVisibleCharacter(text: string): boolean {
```

`backend/src/lib/rateLimit.ts` — add to `RATE_LIMITS` after `handle: …,`:

```ts
  campNote: { name: 'camp_note', limit: 20, windowSeconds: 60 * 60 },
```

`backend/src/buddies/errors.ts` — after `undo_expired: 409,` add:

```ts
  invalid_note: 400,
```

`mobile/src/lib/buddyCopy.ts` — in `ERRORS`, after `undo_expired: …,` add:

```ts
  invalid_note: 'Notes are 1 to 40 characters.',
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Write `campNotes.ts`**

`backend/src/social/campNotes.ts`:

```ts
// Camp notes (spec 2026-10-07 social §6.3): one short note per author, shown in a speech bubble over their coach on
// the Campfire page. Sanitised like a display name (NFC; controls and format characters removed, so no newlines;
// trimmed; no reserved-word check), 1–40 code points with something visible. Sharing replaces the note. It clears
// at the next 06:00 in the author's zone or at their first check-in of a day at or after it, whichever is first
// (saveCheckIn deletes it; reads hide it too); expired rows are hidden at read time and deleted by the social sweep.
// 20 shares an hour per author, failing closed; clearing your own note is never limited and never fails closed.
// URLs and @handles are allowed in S2; reporting a note arrives in S3. No push.
// The text is user free text: never logged (not even its length), never sent to the coach, and never part of
// /me/social, the timeline, story frames or highlights. Only GET /me/camp returns it (camp.ts).

import { prisma } from '../db/client';
import { BuddyError, limitOrThrow } from '../buddies/errors';
import { hasVisibleCharacter, sanitiseDisplayName } from '../buddies/identity';
import { RATE_LIMITS } from '../lib/rateLimit';
import type { Circle } from './circle';
import { nextSunrise } from './night';

export const CAMP_NOTE_MAX = 40;

export interface CampNoteDTO { text: string; createdAt: string; expiresAt: string }

/** The text to store, or null when it is not a valid note. */
export function checkCampNote(raw: unknown): string | null {
  if (typeof raw !== 'string') return null;
  const text = sanitiseDisplayName(raw);
  const length = [...text].length;

    where: { authorId: userId },
    create: { authorId: userId, text, createdAt: now, expiresAt },
    // createdAt is overwritten with `now` on purpose: a replaced note is a new note, and the clear-on-check-in rule
    // (saveCheckIn, noteIsLive) compares createdAt with the day's first check-in.
    update: { text, createdAt: now, expiresAt },
    select: { text: true, createdAt: true, expiresAt: true },
  });
  return { text: row.text, createdAt: row.createdAt.toISOString(), expiresAt: row.expiresAt.toISOString() };

/** Removing your own note always works: no rate limit, so a limiter outage never keeps words up. */
export async function clearCampNote(userId: string): Promise<void> {
  await prisma.campNote.deleteMany({ where: { authorId: userId } });
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: A check-in clears older notes**

In `backend/src/social/checkins.ts`, replace the body of `saveCheckIn` from `const row = await prisma.checkIn.upsert({`
to the end of the function with:

```ts
  const row = await prisma.checkIn.upsert({
    where: { authorId_localDate: { authorId: userId, localDate } },
    create: { authorId: userId, localDate, mood: mood as CheckInMood, createdAt: now },
    update: { mood: mood as CheckInMood },
    select: { mood: true, localDate: true, createdAt: true, updatedAt: true },
  });
  // A camp note clears when its author checks in (spec §6.3): notes written at or before the day's first check-in
  // go; one written after it survives later edits of that check-in.
  await prisma.campNote.deleteMany({ where: { authorId: userId, createdAt: { lte: row.createdAt } } });
  return toCheckInDTO(row);
}
```

and add to the file header comment: `// Checking in also clears the author's older camp note (spec §6.3).`

- [ ] **Step 6: Add the routes**

In `backend/src/social/routes.ts` add `import { clearCampNote, shareCampNote } from './campNotes';` and append:

```ts
socialRouter.put('/me/camp/note', requireAuth, buddyRoute(async (req, res) => {
  res.json({ note: await shareCampNote(req.userId!, (req.body as { text?: unknown } | undefined)?.text, new Date()) });
}));

socialRouter.delete('/me/camp/note', requireAuth, buddyRoute(async (req, res) => {
  await clearCampNote(req.userId!);
  res.status(204).end();
}));
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the tests**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social/campNotes.test.ts tests/social/checkins.test.ts tests/buddies/identity.test.ts`

Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash

### Task 7: Goodnight story frames and the camp's timeline items

**Files:**
- Modify: `backend/src/social/stories.ts`, `backend/src/social/timeline.ts`, `backend/tests/social/homeQueries.test.ts`
- Test: `backend/tests/social/campTimeline.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Circle.goodnights`, `Circle.checkIns` (Task 3); `noteIsLive` (Task 5); `isNight` (Task 2).
- Produces:
  - `StoryFrameDTO` gains `{ kind: 'goodnight'; at: string; onTime: boolean }` (by the author's local date of `at`; never locked).
  - `TimelineItemDTO` gains `(Base & { kind: 'goodnight'; onTime: boolean })` (id `goodnight:<row id>`) and
    `(Base & { kind: 'camp_note' })` (id `camp_note:<authorId>:<createdAt ms>`; never the text; only a live note
    written in its author's night).
  - The home read costs one more query (camp notes in the timeline): the ceiling in `homeQueries.test.ts` becomes 17.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to see it fail**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social/campTimeline.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — no goodnight frame (frames `[]`) and no goodnight / camp_note timeline items.

- [ ] **Step 3: Goodnight frames**

In `backend/src/social/stories.ts`:

Replace the `StoryFrameDTO` type with:

```ts
export type StoryFrameDTO =
  | { kind: 'checkin'; at: string; locked: true }
  | { kind: 'checkin'; at: string; locked: false; mood: CheckInMood }
  | { kind: 'badge'; at: string; family: AchievementFamily; level: number }
  | { kind: 'recap'; at: string; recapId: string; recapKind: 'WEEK' | 'MONTH'; periodStart: string; periodEnd: string; line: string; coachId: string }
  | { kind: 'goodnight'; at: string; onTime: boolean };
```

add to the header comment
`// A goodnight (S2) is a frame of the author's local date of the moment it was said, never locked.`, and in
`loadFrames`, just before `for (const frames of byAuthor.values()) frames.sort(…)`, add:

```ts
  for (const g of circle.goodnights) {
    // By the local date of the moment it was said: a 00:30 goodnight opens the new day's story.
    const today = todayOf.get(g.authorId);
    if (today === undefined || localCivilDateOrUtc(g.at, tzOf.get(g.authorId)!) !== today) continue;
    byAuthor.get(g.authorId)!.push({ kind: 'goodnight', at: iso(g.at), onTime: g.onTime });
  }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Goodnight and camp-note timeline items**

In `backend/src/social/timeline.ts`:

Add to the header comment:

```ts
// S2: goodnights (with their on-time flag) and camp notes — "left a camp note", never the text — for a live note
// written during its author's night (19:00–05:59 author-local; the spec's "night only").
```

Add the imports:

```ts
import { noteIsLive } from './campNotes';
import { isNight } from './night';
```

Replace the `TimelineItemDTO` type with:

```ts
export type TimelineItemDTO =
  | (Base & { kind: 'checkin'; locked: true })
  | (Base & { kind: 'checkin'; locked: false; mood: CheckInMood })
  | (Base & { kind: 'step_goal' })
  | (Base & { kind: 'badge'; badge: { family: AchievementFamily; level: number } })
  | (Base & { kind: 'sticker'; sticker: StickerKind; to: PersonDTO })
  | (Base & { kind: 'recap_share'; recapKind: 'WEEK' | 'MONTH' })
  | (Base & { kind: 'goodnight'; onTime: boolean })
  | (Base & { kind: 'camp_note' });
```

Replace the `Promise.all` destructuring line `const [checkIns, steps, badges, stickers, shares] = await Promise.all([`
with `const [checkIns, steps, badges, stickers, shares, notes] = await Promise.all([`, and add a sixth query after the
`recapShare.findMany(…)` entry:

```ts
    // Never the text: the timeline only says that a note exists.
    prisma.campNote.findMany({ where: { authorId: { in: ids }, createdAt: { gte: since }, expiresAt: { gt: now } }, select: { authorId: true, createdAt: true, expiresAt: true } }),
```

Before `items.sort(…)`, add:

```ts
  for (const g of circle.goodnights) push(g.authorId, g.at, { id: `goodnight:${g.id}`, kind: 'goodnight', onTime: g.onTime });
  for (const n of notes) {
    const author = members.get(n.authorId);
    if (!author || !isNight(n.createdAt, author.timezone) || !noteIsLive(n, circle, now)) continue;
    push(n.authorId, n.createdAt, { id: `camp_note:${n.authorId}:${n.createdAt.getTime()}`, kind: 'camp_note' });
  }
```

- [ ] **Step 5: The home's query ceiling moves to 17**

In `backend/tests/social/homeQueries.test.ts`, change the test name's `in at most 16 queries` to `in at most 17 queries`,
the comment to `// S1 read ~26: loadCircle 4 + rings 3 + timeline 6 (camp notes since S2) + cached highlights 1 + requests 2 + stickers 1.`
and `toBeLessThanOrEqual(16)` to `toBeLessThanOrEqual(17)`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social`
Expected: PASS (the S1 `timeline.test.ts` `ALLOWED` shapes are untouched: its fixtures have no goodnights or notes).

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add backend/src/social/stories.ts backend/src/social/timeline.ts backend/tests/social/campTimeline.test.ts backend/tests/social/homeQueries.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(social): goodnight story frames and goodnight and camp-note timeline items, never the note text"
```

### Task 8: The Social home carries the camp

**Files:**
- Modify: `backend/src/social/home.ts`, `backend/tests/social/home.test.ts`
- Test: `backend/tests/social/homeCamp.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `campSummaryFor` (Task 6); `GoodnightDTO`, `sayGoodnight` (Task 4).
- Produces: `SocialHomeDTO.me = { person; checkIn; goodnight: GoodnightDTO | null }` and
  `SocialHomeDTO.camp = { checkedIn; members; faces; night: boolean; awake: number; asleep: number; goodnightOpen: boolean }`
  (no extra query; `night` = the scene in my zone, 19:00–05:59, for the banner; `goodnightOpen` = my own goodnight
  window, for the evening timeline's button, Task 12).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

`backend/tests/social/homeCamp.test.ts`:

```ts
import { prisma } from '../../src/db/client';
import { connection } from '../../src/sync/queue';
import { migrateTestDb } from '../setupTestDb';
import { civilDateToUtcMidnight } from '../../src/biometrics/civilDate';
import { saveCheckIn } from '../../src/social/checkins';
import { sayGoodnight } from '../../src/social/goodnight';
import { getSocialHome } from '../../src/social/home';
import { buddyUser, pairUp } from '../buddies/helpers';

beforeAll(() => migrateTestDb());
afterAll(async () => {
  await prisma.$disconnect();
  await connection.quit();
});

const LA = 'America/Los_Angeles';
const NIGHT = new Date('2026-10-08T05:30:00Z'); // Oct 7, 22:30 in Los Angeles

it('at night the camp counts awake and asleep, me.goodnight is mine for Undo, and no note text is in the bundle', async () => {
  const me = await buddyUser({ timezone: LA });
  const sam = await buddyUser({ timezone: LA });
  const ana = await buddyUser({ timezone: LA });
  await pairUp(me.id, sam.id);
  await pairUp(me.id, ana.id);
  await saveCheckIn(sam.id, 'RESTED', new Date('2026-10-07T15:00:00Z')); // 08:00
  await prisma.goodnight.create({ data: { authorId: sam.id, localDate: civilDateToUtcMidnight('2026-10-07'), at: new Date('2026-10-08T05:00:00Z'), onTime: true } });
  await prisma.campNote.create({ data: { authorId: sam.id, text: 'secret words', createdAt: new Date('2026-10-08T05:05:00Z'), expiresAt: new Date('2026-10-08T13:00:00Z') } });

  const before = await getSocialHome(me.id, NIGHT);
  expect(before.camp).toEqual({ checkedIn: 1, members: 3, faces: [expect.any(String)], night: true, awake: 2, asleep: 1, goodnightOpen: true });
  expect(before.me.goodnight).toBeNull();
  const said = await sayGoodnight(me.id, NIGHT);
  const after = await getSocialHome(me.id, NIGHT);
  expect(after.me.goodnight).toEqual(said);
  expect(after.camp).toMatchObject({ awake: 1, asleep: 2 });
  expect(JSON.stringify(after)).not.toContain('secret words');
});

it('by day the camp is not night and everyone is awake', async () => {
  const me = await buddyUser({ timezone: LA });
  const day = new Date('2026-10-07T20:00:00Z'); // 13:00
  expect((await getSocialHome(me.id, day)).camp).toEqual({ checkedIn: 0, members: 1, faces: [], night: false, awake: 1, asleep: 0, goodnightOpen: false });
});

it('the goodnight window is mine: open at 17:30 with an 18:00 goal though not night, closed at 19:30 with no goal though night', async () => {
  const early = await buddyUser({ timezone: LA });
  await prisma.user.update({ where: { id: early.id }, data: { bedtimeGoal: '18:00' } });
  expect((await getSocialHome(early.id, new Date('2026-10-08T00:30:00Z'))).camp).toMatchObject({ night: false, goodnightOpen: true }); // 17:30
  const late = await buddyUser({ timezone: LA });
  expect((await getSocialHome(late.id, new Date('2026-10-08T02:30:00Z'))).camp).toMatchObject({ night: true, goodnightOpen: false }); // 19:30
});
```

`backend/tests/social/home.test.ts` — the S1 shape assertions gain the new fields (the route reads the real clock, so
`night` may be either):

```ts
  expect(res.body.me).toEqual({ person: expect.objectContaining({ id: me.id, displayName: 'Me' }), checkIn: null, goodnight: null });
  expect(res.body.camp).toEqual({
    checkedIn: 1, members: 3, faces: [res.body.stories[0].author.coachId],
    night: expect.any(Boolean), awake: 3, asleep: 0, goodnightOpen: expect.any(Boolean),
  });
```

(these replace the two lines `expect(res.body.me).toEqual({ person: …, checkIn: null });` and
`expect(res.body.camp).toEqual({ checkedIn: 1, members: 3, faces: [res.body.stories[0].author.coachId] });` in the first test).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to see them fail**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social/homeCamp.test.ts tests/social/home.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `camp` has no `night` / `awake` / `asleep` / `goodnightOpen`, `me` has no `goodnight`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Put the summary on the home**

In `backend/src/social/home.ts`:

Add to the header comment: `// S2: the camp banner also says whether it is night in the viewer's zone and who is awake or asleep; \`me\`
// carries my goodnight for tonight (the evening timeline's Undo) and \`camp.goodnightOpen\` says whether my own
// goodnight window is open (min(20:00, my goal − 60 min) to 05:59) — all from the circle, no extra query.`

Add the imports:

```ts
import { campSummaryFor } from './camp';
import type { GoodnightDTO } from './goodnight';
```

Change the interface's two lines to:

```ts
  me: { person: PersonDTO; checkIn: CheckInDTO | null; goodnight: GoodnightDTO | null };
  camp: { checkedIn: number; members: number; faces: string[]; night: boolean; awake: number; asleep: number; goodnightOpen: boolean };
```

In `getSocialHome`, after `const mine = circle.checkIns.get(viewerId);` add `const camp = campSummaryFor(circle, now);`
and change the returned `me` and `camp` to:

```ts
    me: { person: circle.viewer.person, checkIn: mine ? toCheckInDTO(mine) : null, goodnight: camp.goodnight },
    camp: {
      checkedIn: rings.checkedInBuddies + (rings.viewerCheckedIn ? 1 : 0),
      members: circle.members.size,
      faces: rings.checkedInCoachIds,
      night: camp.night,
      awake: camp.awake,
      asleep: camp.asleep,
      goodnightOpen: camp.goodnightOpen,
    },
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social`
Expected: PASS (the query ceiling of 17 holds: the summary reads only the circle).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add backend/src/social/home.ts backend/tests/social/homeCamp.test.ts backend/tests/social/home.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(social): the Social home says night or day, who is awake or asleep, my goodnight and its window"
```

### Task 9: The camp's week highlights (incl. the deferred "joined" and "first badge")

**Files:**
- Modify: `backend/src/social/highlights.ts`
- Test: `backend/tests/social/highlightsCamp.test.ts`; the S1 `tests/social/highlights.test.ts` must stay green unchanged

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `campOnEvening`, `countLitNights` (Task 2); `Circle` (incl. `pairedAt`), `loadCircle` (Task 3); the
  `Goodnight` table; `EMPTY_WEEK_SETTLE_MS`, `weeklyHighlightsFor` (Task 3).
- Produces: `HighlightItem` gains `{ type: 'top_story'; reason: 'on_time_every_night'; actorId }`,
  `{ type: 'campfire'; actorId; nights: number }` (actor = the viewer), `{ type: 'joined'; actorId }`,
  `{ type: 'first_badge'; actorId }`; `HighlightItemDTO` follows (`actor`, `mine` instead of `actorId`).
  `buildHighlightCandidates(circle: Circle, weekStart: string)` (was `(viewerId, memberIds, weekStart)`; its only
  caller is `weeklyHighlightsFor`): `joined` comes from `circle.pairedAt` (no query), and `campfire` counts each night
  against that night's camp (`campOnEvening`: the viewer plus the buddies paired by its 19:00 in the viewer's zone).
  Candidate order: badge top stories, on-time top story, every-day top story, most cheered, comeback, campfire,
  every-day (≤ 3 shown), joined (≤ 3), first badge (≤ 3), most stickers sent.
- Known cost, accepted: a `first_badge` evaluated late (a badge backfilled after the week was cached) misses that
  already-cached week, the same as the S1 top story — the cache is built once.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to see it fail**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social/highlightsCamp.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — none of the new item types are built (the first test gets `null`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Build and gate the new items**

In `backend/src/social/highlights.ts`:

Replace the header comment's last line (`// "Joined" and "first badge" items (spec §7 \`also\`) are deferred to S2.`) with:

```ts
// S2 adds the camp's items: an on-time goodnight every night (a top story, no streak gate), the campfire ("the fire
// was lit N nights", N >= 2 — a count of the circle's own goodnights, each night judged against that night's camp:
// the viewer plus the buddies paired by its 19:00 in the viewer's zone), "joined the camp" (a buddy who paired with
// the viewer that week, from the circle's pairing times) and "first badge" (a member's first-ever badge earned that
// week, gated by streaks like every badge item, and not repeated when that person's badge is the top story). Weeks
// cached before S2 keep their items; a badge backfilled after a week was cached misses it, as the S1 top story does.
```

Add `import { campOnEvening, countLitNights } from './night';` to the imports.

In `weeklyHighlightsFor` (Task 3), replace
`const candidates = await buildHighlightCandidates(viewerId, memberIds, weekStart);` with
`const candidates = await buildHighlightCandidates(circle, weekStart);`, and delete the now-unused line
`const memberIds = [viewerId, ...circle.buddies.map((b) => b.person.id)];`.

Replace `export type HighlightItem = …;` with:

```ts
export type HighlightItem =
  | { type: 'top_story'; reason: 'badge'; actorId: string; family: AchievementFamily; level: number }
  | { type: 'top_story'; reason: 'on_time_every_night'; actorId: string }
  | { type: 'top_story'; reason: 'checked_in_every_day'; actorId: string }
  | { type: 'most_cheered_you'; actorId: string; count: number }
  | { type: 'comeback'; actorId: string }
  | { type: 'campfire'; actorId: string; nights: number }
  | { type: 'checked_in_every_day'; actorId: string }
  | { type: 'joined'; actorId: string }
  | { type: 'first_badge'; actorId: string }
  | { type: 'most_stickers_sent'; actorId: string; count: number };
```

Replace the constants block `const MAX_EVERY_DAY = 3; … const MIN_STICKERS_SENT = 3;` with:

```ts
const MAX_EVERY_DAY = 3;
/** "Joined" and "first badge" items shown per week, each. */
const MAX_ALSO = 3;
const MIN_CHEERED_YOU = 2;
const MIN_STICKERS_SENT = 3;
const MIN_LIT_NIGHTS = 2;

Replace the whole `buildHighlightCandidates` function with:

    .map((f) => f.userId)
    .sort();

  const items: HighlightItem[] = [];
  const withBadge = new Set<string>();
  for (const b of badges) {
    if (withBadge.has(b.userId)) continue; // each member's best badge only
    withBadge.add(b.userId);

Replace the whole `visibleItems` function with:

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social/highlightsCamp.test.ts tests/social/highlights.test.ts tests/social/homeQueries.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (in the S1 suite, Sam's badge is both the top story and his first badge, so no `first_badge` item
appears, and its pairs were made at the real clock, outside the fixed week, so no `joined` item either).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add backend/src/social/highlights.ts backend/tests/social/highlightsCamp.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(social): camp highlights: on time every night, campfire, joined the camp and first badge"
```

### Task 10: Retention and deleted ids (S1 deferral b)

**Files:**
- Create: `backend/src/social/sweep.ts`
- Modify: `backend/src/sync/worker.ts`, `backend/src/buddies/models.ts`, `backend/src/users/deletion.ts`,
  `backend/tests/recap/worker.test.ts` (mock the social sweep)
- Test: `backend/tests/social/retention.test.ts`; rerun `tests/recap/worker.test.ts`, `tests/coach/retention.test.ts`, `tests/users/deletion.test.ts`, `tests/buddies/deletion.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `RECAP_SWEEP_JOB` (`src/recap/queue.ts`), `runRecapSweep` (`src/recap/sweep.ts`), `processSyncJob`
  (`src/sync/worker.ts`); `getWeeklyHighlights` (Task 3).
- Produces:
  - `sweep.ts`: `HIGHLIGHTS_RETENTION_WEEKS = 4`, `runSocialSweep(now): Promise<{ notes: number; highlights: number }>`.
  - The `RECAP_SWEEP_JOB` branch of `processSyncJob` runs `runSocialSweep(sweepClock(job))` first (never throws;
    logs counts or the error's name), then `runRecapSweep()`. `sweepClock(job)` = `job.data.now` when it is a valid
    ISO instant (tests pin the clock this way; the scheduler sends `{}`), else the real clock. `processSyncJob` keeps
    its one-argument signature (BullMQ passes a token as the second).
- Test isolation (the backend suites share one database): no test runs the sweep on the real clock. The retention
  tests use a far-past clock (`2025-02-10T12:00Z`) and far-past fixtures (weeks `2025-01-06` and `2025-01-13`, notes
  expiring in February 2025), which no other suite writes, and assert only on their own rows; the S1
  `tests/recap/worker.test.ts`, which runs the same tick, mocks `runSocialSweep`.
  - `buddies/models.ts`: `purgeSocialJsonMentions(db: Pick<PrismaClient, '$executeRaw'>, userId: string): Promise<number>`;
    `deleteUserAccount` calls it (best effort) before deleting the rows.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```

`backend/tests/recap/worker.test.ts` (S1) runs the same tick, which would now sweep the shared database on the real
clock. After its two existing `jest.mock(…)` lines add:

```ts
// The social sweep (S2) shares this tick; it is tested in tests/social/retention.test.ts on a pinned clock.
jest.mock('../../src/social/sweep', () => ({ runSocialSweep: jest.fn(async () => ({ notes: 0, highlights: 0 })) }));
```

add `import { runSocialSweep } from '../../src/social/sweep';` to its imports, and after
`expect(runRecapSweep).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);` add `expect(runSocialSweep).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to see it fail**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social/retention.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — "Cannot find module '../../src/social/sweep'".

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the sweep and wire it to the hourly tick**

`backend/src/social/sweep.ts`:

```ts
// The social sweep (S2), on the existing hourly recap-sweep tick (sync/worker.ts): deletes camp notes past their
// expiry (reads already hide them; this removes the free text itself) and week-highlight caches more than
// HIGHLIGHTS_RETENTION_WEEKS old (only the latest final week is ever served). Returns counts only.

import { civilDateToUtcMidnight } from '../biometrics/civilDate';
import { prisma } from '../db/client';
import { shiftDate } from '../scoring/dates';

export const HIGHLIGHTS_RETENTION_WEEKS = 4;

export async function runSocialSweep(now: Date): Promise<{ notes: number; highlights: number }> {
  const notes = await prisma.campNote.deleteMany({ where: { expiresAt: { lte: now } } });
  const cutoff = civilDateToUtcMidnight(shiftDate(now.toISOString().slice(0, 10), -7 * HIGHLIGHTS_RETENTION_WEEKS));
  const highlights = await prisma.weeklyHighlights.deleteMany({ where: { weekStart: { lt: cutoff } } });
  return { notes: notes.count, highlights: highlights.count };
}
```

In `backend/src/sync/worker.ts`, add `import { runSocialSweep } from '../social/sweep';` after the `recordStepGoal`
import; just above `export async function processSyncJob(job: Job): Promise<void> {` add:

```ts
/**
 * The social sweep's clock: `job.data.now` when a test pins it (a valid ISO instant), else the real clock. The
 * scheduler sends `{}`. Not a second processSyncJob parameter: BullMQ passes the worker token there.
 */
function sweepClock(job: Job): Date {
  const pinned = (job.data as { now?: unknown } | undefined)?.now;
  const at = typeof pinned === 'string' ? new Date(pinned) : null;
  return at && !Number.isNaN(at.getTime()) ? at : new Date();
}
```

and replace

```ts
  } else if (job.name === RECAP_SWEEP_JOB) {
    await runRecapSweep();
```

with

```ts
  } else if (job.name === RECAP_SWEEP_JOB) {
    // The hourly tick also runs the social sweep (expired camp notes, old highlight caches). It goes first and never
    // throws, so a social failure cannot stop recaps. Counts and the error's name only.
    await runSocialSweep(sweepClock(job)).then(
      (r) => console.info(JSON.stringify({ event: 'social.sweep', ...r })),
      (err: unknown) => console.error(JSON.stringify({ event: 'social.sweep_failed', error: err instanceof Error ? err.name : 'unknown' })),
    );
    await runRecapSweep();
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Purge JSON-held ids on account deletion**

Append to `backend/src/buddies/models.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * Week-highlight caches (WeeklyHighlights.items) name people by id inside JSON, which no foreign key can cascade.
 * On account deletion every cache naming the user is deleted; the next read rebuilds it from rows that no longer
 * include them. Reads also gate every cached actor against the live circle, so a deleted id never surfaces even if
 * this purge fails. Returns the number of caches deleted.
 */
export async function purgeSocialJsonMentions(db: Pick<PrismaClient, '$executeRaw'>, userId: string): Promise<number> {
  return db.$executeRaw`DELETE FROM "WeeklyHighlights" WHERE "items" @> ${JSON.stringify([{ actorId: userId }])}::jsonb`;
}
```

with `import type { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';` at the top of the file (after the header comment).

In `backend/src/users/deletion.ts`, add `import { purgeSocialJsonMentions } from '../buddies/models';` and, just
before `const counts = await deleteOwnedRows(prisma, { userId }, { id: userId });`, add:

```ts
  // Week-highlight caches name people inside JSON, beyond any cascade (buddies/models.ts). Best effort: reads gate
  // every cached actor against the live circle anyway. Only the error class is logged.
  try {
    await purgeSocialJsonMentions(prisma, userId);
  } catch (err) {
    log(`Account deletion: could not purge social mentions for user ${userId}: ${err instanceof Error ? err.name : 'unknown error'}`);
  }
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/social/retention.test.ts tests/recap/worker.test.ts tests/coach/retention.test.ts tests/users/deletion.test.ts tests/buddies/deletion.test.ts`
Expected: PASS.
Run: `grep -rn "runSocialSweep(\|RECAP_SWEEP_JOB, data" backend/tests` — Expected: every call passes `SWEEP_NOW` or a
`data.now`, or sits in a file that mocks `../../src/social/sweep` (no sweep on the real clock).

### Task 11: Mobile camp API and copy

**Files:**
- Modify: `mobile/src/api/social.ts`, `mobile/src/lib/socialCopy.ts`, `mobile/src/components/social/TimelineList.tsx`
- Test: create `mobile/__tests__/api/camp.test.ts`, `mobile/__tests__/lib/campCopy.test.ts`; rerun the S1
  `__tests__/api/social.test.ts`, `__tests__/lib/socialCopy.test.ts`, `__tests__/components/TimelineList.test.tsx`,
  `__tests__/components/HighlightsCarousel.test.tsx`, `__tests__/screens/HighlightsScreen.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the backend DTOs of Tasks 4–9 (`GoodnightDTO`, `CampDTO`, `CampMemberDTO`, `CampNoteDTO`, the new
  timeline / frame / highlight variants, `SocialHomeDTO.me.goodnight`, `camp.night|awake|asleep|goodnightOpen`,
  `CampDTO.goodnightOpen|goodnightOpensAt`).
- Produces:
  - `api/social.ts`: types `Goodnight`, `CampMember`, `Camp` (with `goodnightOpen: boolean; goodnightOpensAt: string`),
    `CampNote`; `StoryFrame`, `TimelineItem`, `HighlightItem` gain the S2 variants; `SocialHome.me.goodnight?: Goodnight | null`,
    `SocialHome.camp.night?: boolean`, `awake?: number`, `asleep?: number`, `goodnightOpen?: boolean` (optional: an S1
    server sends none); `fetchCamp(): Promise<Camp | null>` (null = bare 404), `sayGoodnight(): Promise<{ goodnight: Goodnight }>`,
    `undoGoodnight(): Promise<void>`, `saveCampNote(text: string): Promise<{ note: CampNote }>`, `clearCampNote(): Promise<void>`.
  - `socialCopy.ts`: `CAMP_NOTE_MAX = 40`, `noteLength(draft): number`, `campBannerLine(camp: SocialHome['camp']): string`,
    `fireLine(fire: Camp['fire']): string`, `campClock(iso: string): string` ("10:15 PM", the phone's clock),
    `campStatus(m: CampMember): string` ("asleep since 10:15 PM · on time"), `goodnightSaidLine(g: Goodnight): string`,
    `goodnightOpensLine(opensAt: string): string` ("You can say goodnight from 8:00 PM"), `campKicker(now: Date): string`
    ("TUESDAY · 10:42 PM"): every time on the Campfire is 12-hour. The known-kind lists, `timelineParts`,
    `timelineAction`, `highlightKicker`, `highlightKickerColor`, `highlightLine` cover the S2 kinds. (`clockTime`,
    the S1 timeline's time, is unchanged.)

- [ ] **Step 5: Timeline dot colours for the new kinds**

In `mobile/src/components/social/TimelineList.tsx`, replace the `DOT` line with:

```ts
const DOT: Record<TimelineItem['kind'], string> = {
  checkin: '#93C5FD', step_goal: '#FB923C', badge: '#FCD34D', sticker: '#F9A8D4', recap_share: '#A5B4FC', goodnight: '#A78BFA', camp_note: '#C7D2FE',
};
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests and the typecheck**

Run (from `mobile/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/jest --forceExit __tests__/api/camp.test.ts __tests__/lib/campCopy.test.ts __tests__/api/social.test.ts __tests__/lib/socialCopy.test.ts __tests__/components/TimelineList.test.tsx __tests__/components/HighlightsCarousel.test.tsx __tests__/screens/HighlightsScreen.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS.
Run: `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit --types jest,node --pretty false | grep -c "error TS"` — Expected: `12`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add mobile/src/api/social.ts mobile/src/lib/socialCopy.ts mobile/src/components/social/TimelineList.tsx mobile/__tests__/api/camp.test.ts mobile/__tests__/lib/campCopy.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(social-app): camp API and copy: goodnight, camp notes, camp timeline items and highlights"
```

### Task 12: The banner opens the camp; goodnight in the evening timeline

**Files:**
- Create: `mobile/src/components/social/GoodnightButton.tsx`
- Modify: `mobile/src/components/social/CampBanner.tsx`, `mobile/src/screens/SocialScreen.tsx`,
  `mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` (route type only)
- Test: create `mobile/__tests__/components/CampBanner.test.tsx`, `mobile/__tests__/components/GoodnightButton.test.tsx`,
  `mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialScreenCampfire.test.tsx`; rerun `mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialScreen.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `sayGoodnight`, `undoGoodnight`, `Goodnight`, `SocialHome` (Task 11); `campBannerLine`, `goodnightSaidLine`
  (Task 11); `buddyErrorMessage` with the Task 4 codes.
- Produces:
  - `CampBanner({ camp: SocialHome['camp']; onOpen?: () => void })` — testIDs `camp-banner`, `camp-banner-line`,
    `camp-face-<i>`; pressable only with `onOpen`.
  - `GoodnightButton({ goodnight: Goodnight | null; onChanged: () => void; testID?: string })` — testIDs
    `<testID>-say`, `<testID>-said`, `<testID>-undo`, `<testID>-message` (default testID `goodnight`).
  - `RootStackParamList.Campfire: undefined` (the screen is registered in Task 13).
  - SocialScreen: the banner opens `Campfire` when `home.camp.night !== undefined`; under Today, while my goodnight
    window is open (`home.camp.goodnightOpen === true`, owner ruling Q1 — not the scene's `night`) and
    `home.me.goodnight !== undefined`, a `GoodnightButton` with testID `timeline-goodnight`.

Expected: FAIL — `GoodnightButton` doesn't exist; `CampBanner` has no `camp` prop or `camp-banner-line`.

- [ ] **Step 3: The banner**

Replace `mobile/src/components/social/CampBanner.tsx` with:

```tsx
// The camp banner (spec 2026-10-07 social §4, item 1): "THE CAMP" over "{awake} awake · {asleep} asleep" at night
// (19:00–05:59 in my zone) or "{n} checked in" by day, a small fire, and up to two coach faces of buddies who checked
// in today. Tapping it opens the Campfire page (S2) — given `onOpen`, which the Social screen passes only when the
// server has a Campfire (it sends `camp.night`); an S1 server keeps the static strip.

import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import type { SocialHome } from '../../api/social';
import { campBannerLine } from '../../lib/socialCopy';
import { Character } from '../characters/Character';
import { DEFAULT_CHARACTER_ID, isCharacterId } from '../characters/types';
import { pixelFont } from '../coach/thinking/shared';
import { PressableScale } from '../ui/pressable-scale';
import { Text } from '../ui/text';

const STRIP = 'h-[74px] flex-row items-center gap-3 overflow-hidden rounded-tile bg-[#0F1230] px-4';

export function CampBanner({ camp, onOpen }: { camp: SocialHome['camp']; onOpen?: () => void }) {
  const line = campBannerLine(camp);
  const body = (
    <>

    <PressableScale testID="camp-banner" accessibilityRole="button" accessibilityLabel={`Open the camp, ${line}`} onPress={onOpen} className={STRIP}>
      {body}
    </PressableScale>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: The goodnight button**

`mobile/src/components/social/GoodnightButton.tsx`:

```tsx
// "Say goodnight" (spec 2026-10-07 social §6.1), on the Campfire page and under the evening timeline. Once said:
// "Goodnight said" (", on time" when it was), with Undo for its 10 minutes — the button disappears by itself when
// they are up. `onChanged` re-reads whatever shows the goodnight. A refusal shows the server's reason in words.

import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { buddyErrorCode } from '../../api/buddies';
import { sayGoodnight, undoGoodnight, type Goodnight } from '../../api/social';
import { buddyErrorMessage } from '../../lib/buddyCopy';
import { goodnightSaidLine } from '../../lib/socialCopy';
import { Button } from '../ui/button';
import { Text } from '../ui/text';

export function GoodnightButton({ goodnight, onChanged, testID = 'goodnight' }: { goodnight: Goodnight | null; onChanged: () => void; testID?: string }) {
  const [busy, setBusy] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [now, setNow] = useState(() => Date.now());
  // `busy` disables the button only after a re-render; a double tap in one frame sends once.
  const sending = useRef(false);
  const mounted = useRef(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    mounted.current = true;
    return () => {
      mounted.current = false;
    };
  }, []);

  const undoUntil = goodnight ? Date.parse(goodnight.undoUntil) : 0;
  // Re-render when the undo window closes, so Undo goes away by itself.
  useEffect(() => {
    const left = undoUntil - Date.now();
    if (left <= 0) return undefined;
    const timer = setTimeout(() => setNow(Date.now()), left + 1);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [undoUntil]);

  async function run(action: () => Promise<unknown>) {
    if (sending.current) return;
    sending.current = true;
    setBusy(true);
    setMessage(null);
    try {
      await action();
      onChanged();
    } catch (e) {
      if (mounted.current) setMessage(buddyErrorMessage(buddyErrorCode(e)));
    } finally {
      sending.current = false;
      if (mounted.current) setBusy(false);
    }
  }

  return (
    <View className="gap-2">
      {goodnight ? (
        <View className="flex-row items-center justify-between gap-2">
          <Text testID={`${testID}-said`} className="text-sm font-semibold">{goodnightSaidLine(goodnight)}</Text>
          {undoUntil > now ? (
            <Button testID={`${testID}-undo`} variant="secondary" size="sm" disabled={busy} onPress={() => void run(undoGoodnight)}>Undo</Button>
          ) : null}
        </View>
      ) : (
        <Button testID={`${testID}-say`} disabled={busy} onPress={() => void run(sayGoodnight)}>Say goodnight</Button>
      )}
      {message ? <Text testID={`${testID}-message`} className="text-sm text-destructive">{message}</Text> : null}
    </View>
  );
}
```

(In the fake-timer test, `advanceTimersByTime(5_001)` reaches the `left + 1` timer: `left` is 5 000 at mount.)

- [ ] **Step 5: The route type and the Social screen**

In `mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`, in `RootStackParamList` after `SocialStory: { authorId: string };`, add:

```ts
  // Social → the camp banner: the Campfire page (S2), pushed with no tab bar.
  Campfire: undefined;
```

In `mobile/src/screens/SocialScreen.tsx`:

Change the header comment to:

```tsx
// Social tab home — V5 one scroll (spec 2026-10-07 social §4): camp banner → stories with my check-in → week
// highlights → today timeline, and a floating Chats button (opens Buddies until S3). Unseen stickers are marked
// seen once the screen has shown them, so the tab dot clears where they are read. S2: the banner opens the Campfire
// (only on a server that has one: it sends camp.night), and while my goodnight window is open (camp.goodnightOpen:
// from min(20:00, my goal − 60 min) to 05:59) "Say goodnight" follows the timeline.
```

Add `import { GoodnightButton } from '../components/social/GoodnightButton';` after the `CampBanner` import.

Replace `<CampBanner checkedIn={home.camp.checkedIn} faces={home.camp.faces} />` with:

```tsx
        <CampBanner camp={home.camp} onOpen={home.camp.night === undefined ? undefined : () => navigation.navigate('Campfire')} />
```

Replace the Today block

```tsx
        <View className="gap-3">
          <SectionLabel>Today</SectionLabel>
          <TimelineList items={home.timeline} />
        </View>
```

with

```tsx
        <View className="gap-3">
          <SectionLabel>Today</SectionLabel>
          <TimelineList items={home.timeline} />

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests and the typecheck**

Run (from `mobile/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/jest --forceExit __tests__/components/CampBanner.test.tsx __tests__/components/GoodnightButton.test.tsx __tests__/screens/SocialScreenCampfire.test.tsx __tests__/screens/SocialScreen.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS (the S1 SocialScreen test's home has no `camp.night`, so its banner stays static and still reads "2 checked in").
Run: `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit --types jest,node --pretty false | grep -c "error TS"` — Expected: `12`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add mobile/src/components/social/CampBanner.tsx mobile/src/components/social/GoodnightButton.tsx mobile/src/screens/SocialScreen.tsx mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx mobile/__tests__/components/CampBanner.test.tsx mobile/__tests__/components/GoodnightButton.test.tsx mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialScreenCampfire.test.tsx

### Task 13: The Campfire page

**Files:**
- Create: `mobile/src/screens/CampfireScreen.tsx`
- Modify: `mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` (register the screen)
- Test: `mobile/__tests__/screens/CampfireScreen.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `fetchCamp`, `saveCampNote`, `clearCampNote`, `Camp` (incl. `goodnightOpen`, `goodnightOpensAt`),
  `CampMember` (Task 11); `CAMP_NOTE_MAX`, `noteLength`, `campKicker`, `campStatus`, `fireLine`, `goodnightOpensLine`,
  `personName` (Task 11); `GoodnightButton` (Task 12); `refreshSocial`; routes `BuddyWeek`, `Buddies`.
- Produces: `CampfireScreen` registered as the `Campfire` route (`headerShown: false`). Exported layout constants
  and helpers (pure, tested): `SCENE_HEIGHT = 340`, `SCENE_HEADER_HEIGHT = 60`, `COACH_W = 76`, `COACH_H = 104`,
  `FIRE_W = 50`, `FIRE_H = 48`, `interface Box { left: number; top: number; width: number; height: number }`,
  `seatBoxes(width: number): Box[]` (8 seats), `fireBox(width: number): Box`. testIDs: `campfire`,
  `camp-loading|camp-unavailable|camp-error`, `camp-retry`, `camp-back`, `camp-scene-night|camp-scene-day`, `camp-moon`
  (night only), `camp-fire-lit|camp-fire-unlit`, `camp-coach-<id>`, `camp-bubble-<id>` (one truncated line),
  `camp-bubble-add`, `camp-zz-<id>`, `camp-more`, `camp-note-input`, `camp-note-count`, `camp-note-share`,
  `camp-note-clear`, `camp-message`, `camp-fire-line`, `camp-fire-segment-<0..4>`, `camp-nights-lit`,
  `camp-goodnight-*` (GoodnightButton, while `camp.goodnightOpen`), `camp-goodnight-later` (otherwise:
  "You can say goodnight from {h:mm a}" with my own opening time), `camp-message-camp`, `camp-who-<id>`,
  `camp-who-status-<id>` (the full status and note, no line limit).

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Register the route**

In `mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`, add `import { CampfireScreen } from '../screens/CampfireScreen';` next to
the `HighlightsScreen` import, and after the `Highlights` `<Stack.Screen …/>` line add:

```tsx
              {/* The Campfire (S2): its own header over the scene, no tab bar. */}
              <Stack.Screen name="Campfire" component={CampfireScreen} options={{ headerShown: false }} />
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the test and the typecheck**

Run (from `mobile/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/jest --forceExit __tests__/screens/CampfireScreen.test.tsx __tests__/navigation`
Expected: PASS.
Run: `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit --types jest,node --pretty false | grep -c "error TS"` — Expected: `12`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add mobile/src/screens/CampfireScreen.tsx mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx mobile/__tests__/screens/CampfireScreen.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(social-app): the Campfire page: scene with moon and fixed seats, note bubbles and composer, fire strength, goodnight, who's here"
```

### Task 14: Goodnight frames in the story viewer, and the two S1 viewer fixes (S1 deferral d)

**Files:**
- Modify: `mobile/src/components/social/SocialStoryFrame.tsx`, `mobile/src/screens/SocialStoryScreen.tsx`,
  `mobile/src/screens/SocialScreen.tsx`, `mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` (param type),
  `mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialStoryScreen.test.tsx`, `mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialScreenCampfire.test.tsx`
- Test: create `mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialStoryCampfire.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `StoryFrame` goodnight variant and `knownStoryFrames` (Task 11).
- Produces: `RootStackParamList.SocialStory: { authorId: string; mine?: boolean }`; the Social screen opens my own
  story with `{ authorId, mine: true }` (a buddy's stays `{ authorId }`); the viewer treats `mine: true` as mine even
  while the Social store is not ready; a story with no frames shows `social-story-empty` ("Nothing in this story
  yet."); `SocialStoryFrame` draws a goodnight frame (`story-goodnight`, the coach resting).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialStoryCampfire.test.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';
import { fetchStory } from '../../src/api/social';
import { SocialStoryScreen } from '../../src/screens/SocialStoryScreen';

jest.mock('../../src/api/social', () => ({ ...jest.requireActual('../../src/api/social'), fetchStory: jest.fn(), markStorySeen: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined) }));
// The Social home has not loaded yet: the viewer cannot tell from the store whose story this is.
jest.mock('../../src/lib/socialStore', () => ({ refreshSocial: jest.fn(), useSocial: () => ({ status: 'idle' }) }));
const mockGoBack = jest.fn();
let mockParams: { authorId: string; mine?: boolean } = { authorId: 'me', mine: true };
jest.mock('@react-navigation/native', () => ({
  ...jest.requireActual('@react-navigation/native'),
  useNavigation: () => ({ goBack: mockGoBack }),
  useRoute: () => ({ params: mockParams }),
}));
const metrics = { frame: { x: 0, y: 0, width: 390, height: 844 }, insets: { top: 0, left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0 } };
const renderScreen = () => render(<SafeAreaProvider initialMetrics={metrics}><SocialStoryScreen /></SafeAreaProvider>);
const sam = { id: 'sam', handle: 'sam', displayName: 'Sam', coachId: 'mochi' };
const at = '2026-10-08T05:00:00.000Z';

beforeEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();
  (fetchStory as jest.Mock).mockReset();
  mockParams = { authorId: 'me', mine: true };
});

it('plays my goodnight frame as mine, with no replies, even before the Social home has loaded', async () => {
  (fetchStory as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce({ author: { ...sam, id: 'me' }, localDate: '2026-10-07', frames: [{ kind: 'goodnight', at, onTime: true }] });
  renderScreen();
  expect(await screen.findByTestId('story-goodnight')).toHaveTextContent(/You said goodnight.*On time/);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('social-story-name')).toHaveTextContent('You');
  expect(screen.queryByTestId('story-reply-CHEER')).toBeNull();
});

it("a buddy's late goodnight reads Off to bed, with replies", async () => {
  mockParams = { authorId: 'sam' };
  (fetchStory as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce({ author: sam, localDate: '2026-10-07', frames: [{ kind: 'goodnight', at, onTime: false }] });
  renderScreen();
  expect(await screen.findByTestId('story-goodnight')).toHaveTextContent(/Sam said goodnight.*Off to bed/);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('story-reply-CHEER')).toBeTruthy();
});

it('an empty story says there is nothing in it yet — not that it is gone', async () => {
  mockParams = { authorId: 'sam' };
  (fetchStory as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce({ author: sam, localDate: '2026-10-07', frames: [] });
  renderScreen();
  expect(await screen.findByTestId('social-story-empty')).toHaveTextContent('Nothing in this story yet.');
  expect(screen.queryByText(/anymore/)).toBeNull();
});
```

`mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialStoryScreen.test.tsx` — the S1 empty-story test changes with the copy. Replace the
whole test `it('a story with no frames is not available, never an endless loader', …)` with:

```tsx
it('a story with no frames says there is nothing in it yet, never an endless loader', async () => {
  (fetchStory as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce({ author: sam, localDate: '2026-10-07', frames: [] });
  renderScreen();
  expect(await screen.findByTestId('social-story-empty')).toHaveTextContent(/Nothing in this story yet/);
  expect(screen.queryByTestId('social-story-loading')).toBeNull();
  expect(markStorySeen).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  fireEvent.press(screen.getByTestId('social-story-close'));
  expect(mockGoBack).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

`mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialScreenCampfire.test.tsx` — append:

```tsx
it('my own ring opens my story marked as mine', async () => {
  (fetchSocialHome as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(home({
    me: { person: person('me'), checkIn: { mood: 'RESTED', localDate: '2026-10-07', updatedAt: '2026-10-07T08:00:00.000Z' }, goodnight: null },
  }));
  renderScreen();
  fireEvent.press(await screen.findByTestId('story-me'));
  expect(mockNavigate).toHaveBeenLastCalledWith('SocialStory', { authorId: 'me', mine: true });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to see them fail**

Run (from `mobile/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/jest --forceExit __tests__/screens/SocialStoryCampfire.test.tsx __tests__/screens/SocialStoryScreen.test.tsx __tests__/screens/SocialScreenCampfire.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL — no `story-goodnight`, no `social-story-empty`, my story opened without `mine`, replies shown on my own story.

- [ ] **Step 3: The goodnight frame**

In `mobile/src/components/social/SocialStoryFrame.tsx`:

Change the header comment to:

```tsx
// One frame of a social story (spec 2026-10-07 social §4.2): a check-in (locked until I check in), a badge, a
// shared recap's headline line exactly as its owner previewed and shared it — never the recap's stats JSON — or a
// goodnight (S2: "{name} said goodnight", on time or off to bed, the coach resting).
```

Replace `<Character characterId={coach} mood="idle" size={96} />` with
`<Character characterId={coach} mood={frame.kind === 'goodnight' ? 'resting' : 'idle'} size={96} />`, and after the
`frame.kind === 'recap'` block add:

```tsx
      {frame.kind === 'goodnight' ? (
        <View testID="story-goodnight" pointerEvents="none" className="items-center gap-2">
          <Text className="text-xs font-semibold uppercase tracking-widest text-white/70">{`${who} said goodnight`}</Text>
          <Text className="font-display text-display text-white">{frame.onTime ? 'On time' : 'Off to bed'}</Text>
        </View>
      ) : null}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: The viewer: `mine` from the route, and the empty story's words**

In `mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`, replace

```ts
  // Social → one buddy's story today (or my own once I've checked in), opened from the stories row.
  SocialStory: { authorId: string };
```

with

```ts
  // Social → one buddy's story today (or my own once I've checked in), opened from the stories row. `mine` is set for
  // my own story, so the viewer knows it before the Social home has loaded.
  SocialStory: { authorId: string; mine?: boolean };
```

In `mobile/src/screens/SocialStoryScreen.tsx`:

Add to the header comment: `// A story with no frames left says so ("Nothing in this story yet."); "isn't available anymore" is for one that is gone.`

Replace `type Loaded = …;` with:

```tsx
type Loaded = { phase: 'loading' } | { phase: 'ready'; story: Story } | { phase: 'empty' } | { phase: 'gone' } | { phase: 'error' };
```

Replace `const { authorId } = (useRoute().params ?? {}) as { authorId: string };` with:

```tsx
  const { authorId, mine: mineParam } = (useRoute().params ?? {}) as { authorId: string; mine?: boolean };
```

In `load`, replace
`if (live()) setLoaded(frames.length > 0 ? { phase: 'ready', story: { ...story, frames } } : { phase: 'gone' });` with:

```tsx
      if (live()) setLoaded(frames.length > 0 ? { phase: 'ready', story: { ...story, frames } } : { phase: 'empty' });
```

and change the comment above it to `// Nothing left to play (it emptied since the ring was drawn): say so, never an endless loader.`

Replace `if (loaded.phase === 'ready') return <Viewer story={loaded.story} onClose={leave} />;` with:

```tsx
  if (loaded.phase === 'ready') return <Viewer story={loaded.story} mineHint={mineParam === true} onClose={leave} />;
```

After the `loaded.phase === 'gone'` line in the fallback view, add:

```tsx
        {loaded.phase === 'empty' ? <Text className="text-center text-white">Nothing in this story yet.</Text> : null}
```

Change the `Viewer` signature and its `mine` line to:

```tsx
function Viewer({ story, mineHint, onClose }: { story: Story; mineHint: boolean; onClose: () => void }) {
  const social = useSocial();
  // The route says so for my own story; the store agrees once it has loaded.
  const mine = mineHint || (social.status === 'ready' && social.home.me.person.id === story.author.id);
```

- [ ] **Step 5: The Social screen opens my story as mine**

In `mobile/src/screens/SocialScreen.tsx`, replace
`onOpenStory={(authorId) => navigation.navigate('SocialStory', { authorId })}` with:

```tsx
onOpenStory={(authorId) => navigation.navigate('SocialStory', authorId === home.me.person.id ? { authorId, mine: true } : { authorId })}
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests and the typecheck**

Run (from `mobile/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/jest --forceExit __tests__/screens/SocialStoryCampfire.test.tsx __tests__/screens/SocialStoryScreen.test.tsx __tests__/screens/SocialScreenCampfire.test.tsx __tests__/screens/SocialScreen.test.tsx __tests__/components/StoriesRow.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS.
Run: `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit --types jest,node --pretty false | grep -c "error TS"` — Expected: `12`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add mobile/src/components/social/SocialStoryFrame.tsx mobile/src/screens/SocialStoryScreen.tsx mobile/src/screens/SocialScreen.tsx mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialStoryCampfire.test.tsx mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialStoryScreen.test.tsx mobile/__tests__/screens/SocialScreenCampfire.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(social-app): goodnight story frames; my story is mine before Social loads; an empty story says so"
```

### Task 15: Refresh Social when a buddy push arrives in the foreground (S1 deferral c)

**Files:**
- Modify: `mobile/src/notifications/handler.ts`
- Test: create `mobile/__tests__/notifications/handlerForeground.test.ts`; rerun `mobile/__tests__/notifications/handler.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `getSocialState`, `refreshSocial` (`src/lib/socialStore.ts`).
- Produces: `installNotificationHandler`'s `handleNotification` calls `refreshSocial()` for a well-formed buddy push
  (`buddy_sticker`, `buddy_request`, `buddy_paired`, `buddy_badge`) while the Social store is not `idle`; what it shows
  is unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

`mobile/__tests__/notifications/handlerForeground.test.ts`:

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import { WIND_DOWN_KIND, installNotificationHandler } from '../../src/notifications/handler';
import { getSocialState, refreshSocial } from '../../src/lib/socialStore';

jest.mock('expo-notifications', () => ({
  setNotificationHandler: jest.fn(),
  getLastNotificationResponseAsync: jest.fn(),
  addNotificationResponseReceivedListener: jest.fn(),
}));
jest.mock('../../src/navigation/navigationRef', () => ({ navigationRef: { isReady: jest.fn(), navigate: jest.fn() } }));
jest.mock('../../src/lib/socialStore', () => ({ refreshSocial: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()), getSocialState: jest.fn() }));

const N = Notifications as jest.Mocked<typeof Notifications>;
const notification = (data: Record<string, unknown>) => ({ request: { content: { data } } }) as never;
const UUID = '0f8fad5b-d9cb-469f-a165-70867728950e';
const handle = () => {
  installNotificationHandler();
  return N.setNotificationHandler.mock.calls[0]![0]!.handleNotification;
};

beforeEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();
  (getSocialState as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue({ status: 'ready' });
});

it('a buddy push in the foreground refreshes Social, and is still shown', async () => {
  const handler = handle();

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to see it fail**

Run (from `mobile/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/jest --forceExit __tests__/notifications/handlerForeground.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `refreshSocial` is never called.

- [ ] **Step 3: Refresh on a foreground buddy push**

In `mobile/src/notifications/handler.ts`:

Add `import { getSocialState, refreshSocial } from '../lib/socialStore';` after the `windDown` import, and add to the
header comment: `// A buddy push that arrives while the app is open also re-reads Social (the tab dot and the home), once loaded.`

Replace the `handleNotification` line in `installNotificationHandler` with:

```ts
      handleNotification: async (notification) => {
        const buddy = buddyPushOf(notification);
        // A buddy push while the app is open means Social changed (a sticker, a request, a pairing, a badge): re-read
        // it so the tab dot and the home are current. Only once the store has loaded: idle = signed out or not started.
        if (buddy && getSocialState().status !== 'idle') void refreshSocial();
        return isWindDown(notification) || buddy ? SHOW : HIDE;
      },
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run (from `mobile/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/jest --forceExit __tests__/notifications`
Expected: PASS (the S1 handler test runs with the real store, which is idle there, so it refreshes nothing).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add mobile/src/notifications/handler.ts mobile/__tests__/notifications/handlerForeground.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(social-app): a buddy push in the foreground refreshes Social"
```

### Task 16: Dev seed — a camp note and a goodnight for the walkthrough

**Files:**
- Modify: `backend/scripts/seedSocial.ts`, `backend/tests/scripts/seedSocial.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `eveningDate`, `isOnTime`, `nextSunrise` (Task 2); `getCamp` (Task 6) in the test.
- Produces: `SEED_CAMP_NOTE = 'bed soon, night all'`; `seedSocial(…)` resolves
  `{ buddyCheckedIn: true; stepGoal: true; recapShared: boolean; campNote: true; goodnight: true }` and writes, for the
  buddy, a camp note stamped one second after `now` (so the seed's own check-in does not clear it) and a goodnight
  for the buddy's current evening (written directly: the route only opens at night). Idempotent.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

In `backend/tests/scripts/seedSocial.test.ts`:

Change the import line to `import { SEED_CAMP_NOTE, seedSocial } from '../../scripts/seedSocial';` and add
`import { getCamp } from '../../src/social/camp';`.

In the four existing `toEqual({ buddyCheckedIn: true, stepGoal: true, recapShared: … })` expectations, add
`campNote: true, goodnight: true` — they become:

```ts
  expect(await seedSocial({ email: a.email, buddyEmail: b.email, now: NOW, env: LOCAL })).toEqual({ buddyCheckedIn: true, stepGoal: true, recapShared: false, campNote: true, goodnight: true });
```

(first test),

```ts
  expect(await seedSocial({ email: a.email, buddyEmail: b.email, now: NOW, env: LOCAL })).toEqual({ buddyCheckedIn: true, stepGoal: true, recapShared: true, campNote: true, goodnight: true });
```

(second and third tests), and

```ts
  expect(await seedSocial({ email: a.email, buddyEmail: b.email, now: NOW, env: LOCAL })).toEqual({ buddyCheckedIn: true, stepGoal: true, recapShared: false, campNote: true, goodnight: true });
```

(fourth test). Append:

```ts
it("seeds the buddy's camp: a note over an asleep coach, idempotently", async () => {
  const a = await prisma.user.create({ data: { email: `seed-a-${randomUUID()}@example.com`, name: 'A' } });
  const b = await prisma.user.create({ data: { email: `seed-b-${randomUUID()}@example.com`, name: 'B' } });
  await pairUp(a.id, b.id);
  await seedSocial({ email: a.email, buddyEmail: b.email, now: NOW, env: LOCAL });
  await seedSocial({ email: a.email, buddyEmail: b.email, now: NOW, env: LOCAL });
  expect(await prisma.campNote.findMany({ where: { authorId: b.id }, select: { text: true } })).toEqual([{ text: SEED_CAMP_NOTE }]);
  expect(await prisma.goodnight.count({ where: { authorId: b.id } })).toBe(1);
  // The demo account sees it: NOW is 20:00 in the buddy's zone (UTC), so the camp is at night and the buddy asleep.
  const camp = await getCamp(a.id, NOW);
  expect(camp.night).toBe(true);
  expect(camp.members.find((m) => m.person.id === b.id)).toMatchObject({ asleep: true, note: SEED_CAMP_NOTE });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to see it fail**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/scripts/seedSocial.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `SEED_CAMP_NOTE` is not exported; the results lack `campNote` / `goodnight`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Extend the seed**

In `backend/scripts/seedSocial.ts`:

Replace the header's first paragraph (lines 2–6, up to `Run seedBuddies first: the two accounts must already be buddies.`) with:

```ts
// Dev only: gives the demo account something to see on Social (spec 2026-10-07 social S1 + S2). The buddy
// checks in TIRED and passes their step goal today; if the buddy already checked in today, that mood is
// OVERWRITTEN with TIRED. Their newest built recap with a non-blank line (if any) is shared, with that
// line as the previewed one. For the Campfire (S2) the buddy gets a camp note and a goodnight for their current
// evening, so the camp shows an asleep coach with a bubble. The demo account itself is left unchecked-in so the
// walkthrough shows the lock lifting. Run seedBuddies first: the two accounts must already be buddies.
```

and in the paragraph after the usage line, replace `Idempotent: the\n// check-in is upserted, the step goal and the share are created once.` with
`Idempotent: the\n// check-in, the camp note and the goodnight are upserted, the step goal and the share are created once.`

Add the import `import { eveningDate, isOnTime, nextSunrise } from '../src/social/night';` after the `recordStepGoal`
import, and after the `assertDevDatabase` import add:

```ts
/** The buddy's camp note in the walkthrough (the canvas' line). */
export const SEED_CAMP_NOTE = 'bed soon, night all';
```

Change the `seedSocial` return type to
`Promise<{ buddyCheckedIn: boolean; stepGoal: boolean; recapShared: boolean; campNote: boolean; goodnight: boolean }>`,
and replace its last line `return { buddyCheckedIn: true, stepGoal: true, recapShared: recap !== null };` with:

```ts
  // The buddy's camp, written directly: the goodnight route only opens at night and the walkthrough runs whenever.
  // The note is stamped a second after `now`, so the check-in above (stamped at or before `now`) does not clear it.
  const buddy = await prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { id: buddyId }, select: { timezone: true, bedtimeGoal: true } });
  const noteAt = new Date(now.getTime() + 1000);
  const note = { text: SEED_CAMP_NOTE, createdAt: noteAt, expiresAt: nextSunrise(noteAt, buddy.timezone) };
  await prisma.campNote.upsert({ where: { authorId: buddyId }, create: { authorId: buddyId, ...note }, update: note });
  const evening = civilDateToUtcMidnight(eveningDate(now, buddy.timezone));
  await prisma.goodnight.upsert({
    where: { authorId_localDate: { authorId: buddyId, localDate: evening } },
    create: { authorId: buddyId, localDate: evening, at: now, onTime: isOnTime(now, buddy.timezone, buddy.bedtimeGoal) },
    update: {},
  });
  return { buddyCheckedIn: true, stepGoal: true, recapShared: recap !== null, campNote: true, goodnight: true };
```

(`main` logs the result object: booleans only, never the note text.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh tests/scripts/seedSocial.test.ts`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add backend/scripts/seedSocial.ts backend/tests/scripts/seedSocial.test.ts
git commit -m "chore(seed): the Social seed adds the buddy's camp note and goodnight for the Campfire walkthrough"
```

### Task 17: Whole-phase verification

**Files:** none new; fix-ups only where a check fails (each its own commit).

- [ ] **Step 1: Whole backend suite**

Run: `bash .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s2-campfire/backend-jest.sh` — Expected: PASS (rerun a single failing
suite alone before treating it as real; record flakes in the ledger).

- [ ] **Step 2: Backend typecheck**

Run (from `backend/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` — Expected: no output.

- [ ] **Step 3: Whole mobile suite and typecheck**

Run (from `mobile/`): `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/jest --forceExit` — Expected: PASS.
Run: `PATH=/Users/tushar/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH node node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit --types jest,node --pretty false | grep -c "error TS"`
— Expected: `12`, with the same file list as `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-07-social-s1/tsc-baseline.txt` (none in files this phase touched).

- [ ] **Step 4: Privacy audit**

- `grep -rn "console\.\|log(" backend/src backend/scripts` — read every hit in or
  reaching `src/social`, `src/buddies`, `src/sync/worker.ts`, `src/users/deletion.ts` and `scripts/seedSocial.ts`:
  each is `JSON.stringify({ event, …ids|counts, error: err.name })` or an id-only message; none passes a note, a
  `text` field or a request body (the whole backend, not only `src/social`).
- `grep -n "social.sweep" backend/src/sync/worker.ts` — the two lines log `{ event, notes, highlights }` or `{ event, error }` only.
- `grep -n "text: true" backend/src/social/*.ts` — only `camp.ts` (the Campfire view) selects note text.
- `grep -rln "social/" backend/src/coach backend/src/recap` — no output (nothing social reaches the coach; the recap
  module does not import social).
- `grep -n "stats" backend/src/social/stories.ts` — no output (a recap frame never reads stats).

- [ ] **Step 5: Migration is additive**

Run: `grep -niE "drop|alter column|rename" backend/prisma/migrations/20261010120000_social_campfire/migration.sql` — Expected: no output.

- [ ] **Step 6: Clean tree**

Run: `git status --short` — Expected: no output.

**Not in this task:** the owner walkthrough (controller, after the final whole-branch review): back up the dev DB,
`prisma migrate deploy`, run the dev backend and Metro from the synced run folder, `seedBuddies` then `seedSocial`
for the demo pair, and walk: Social tab → camp banner ("N awake · N asleep" at night) → Campfire (the buddy asleep
with "z z" and the "bed soon, night all" bubble, my dashed "+ Add a note") → share a note (count, 40 limit) → clear it →
Say goodnight → Undo → Say goodnight again → back to Social (banner counts, the timeline's "said goodnight" row and
the Today goodnight button) → my story ring (goodnight frame, no replies) → Highlights (camp items appear only once a
week with goodnights is final). By day: the sky, unlit logs and "You can say goodnight from 8:00 PM" (or an hour
before the demo account's bedtime goal when that is earlier than 21:00). At night: the moon, and eight seats with no
overlap when the circle is that big.

## Self-review notes

- Spec coverage (S2, §12 "goodnight, scene, fire strength, camp notes, Who's here"): goodnight §6.1 → Tasks 2, 4, 12,
  13; scene + day/night + asleep/awake §6.1 → Tasks 6, 13; fire strength + nights lit §6.2 → Tasks 2, 6, 13; camp
  notes §6.3 (sanitiser, 1–40, one per user, bubble, composer with count/Share/Clear, expiry at 06:00 author-zone or
  check-in, sweep, 20 shares/h, no push) → Tasks 1, 5, 6, 10, 13; "Who's here" + Say goodnight / Message camp §6.4 →
  Tasks 6, 13; API §6.4 → Tasks 4, 5, 6; banner night copy §4 item 1 → Tasks 8, 12; `goodnight` story frames §4.2 →
  Tasks 7, 14; timeline goodnights + camp notes "(night only)", no text §5 → Tasks 7, 11; highlights `campfire`,
  `top_story` on-time goodnights, `also` joined + first badge §7 → Tasks 9, 11; privacy §9 (note text never logged,
  never to the coach, unpair/block hide, deletion cascades) → Global Constraints, Tasks 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 17; testing
  §13 (goodnight onTime with/without goal, grace, midnight; fire segments; camp-note sanitising, length, expiry,
  check-in clears; camp members and fire; share/clear/expiry/hidden after unpair/block; share rate limit fails closed,
  clear never limited; deletion cascades; mobile Campfire day/night, asleep/awake, bubbles, composer, goodnight undo)
  → Tasks 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13.
- Owner decisions of plan review 1 (binding), where they landed:
  - Q1 goodnight window `min(20:00, goal − 60 min)`–05:59, scene still 19:00, copy "You can say goodnight from
    {h:mm a}", the timeline button on the window, `goodnight_closed` outside it → Global Constraints, Review Focus 4,
    Task 2 (`goodnightOpensAt`, `isGoodnightOpen`), Task 3 (`Circle.viewerBedtimeGoal`), Task 4 (route + tests:
    18:00 goal opens 17:00 and 18:05 is on time; no goal 19:30 closed, 20:00 open; 23:00 goal opens 20:00), Task 6
    (`goodnightOpen` / `goodnightOpensAt` on `GET /me/camp`), Task 8 (`camp.goodnightOpen` on `/me/social`), Tasks 11–13.
  - Q2 frozen fire nights → Task 2 (`campOnEvening`, `countLitNights` per night), Task 3 (`Circle.pairedAt`), Task 6
    (nights lit; pairing tonight never unlights Monday), Task 9 (campfire highlight; a buddy paired midweek counts from
    that evening).
  - Q3 notes unchanged; Q4 the whole note in "Who's here" → Task 13.
- S1 deferrals: (a) one preloaded circle, ~26 → ≤ 17 queries with a counting test (S1's parts are 15 of them; the
  goodnight read is shared and the camp-note read is the timeline's) → Tasks 3, 7; (b) highlight retention on the
  hourly recap-sweep tick, deleted ids purged on account deletion and filtered at read time → Task 10; (c) foreground
  buddy push → Task 15; (d) my story while the store isn't ready, and the empty-story copy → Task 14 (both cheap).
- S1 rulings S2 amends, each by the owner: an empty highlights week is cached once it has been final for 24 h (Task 3,
  which edits one S1 test's clock — the only S1 test edit besides the shape lines of `home.test.ts`, Task 8, and the
  sweep mock in `tests/recap/worker.test.ts`, Task 10).
- Not in S2 (spec §11/§12): group chat ("Message camp" opens Buddies), DMs (a coach opens the buddy's week), camp-note
  reports (S3 `POST /me/reports`; URLs and @handles are allowed in S2 notes), the camp badge, live sleep detection.
- Type consistency checked across tasks: `Circle` (with `pairedAt`, `viewerBedtimeGoal`) / `GoodnightRow` /
  `TodayCheckIn` (Task 3) are what Tasks 4–9 use; `countLitNights(onTime, campOn)` (Task 2) is called the same way in
  Tasks 6 and 9; `buildHighlightCandidates(circle, weekStart)` (Task 9) is called by `weeklyHighlightsFor` (Task 3, its
  call line changed in Task 9); `GoodnightDTO` (Task 4) = mobile `Goodnight` (Task 11); `CampDTO` / `CampMemberDTO`
  (Task 6, with `goodnightOpen` / `goodnightOpensAt`) = mobile `Camp` / `CampMember`; `CampNoteDTO` = `CampNote`; the
  backend timeline / frame / highlight unions (Tasks 7, 9) = the mobile unions (Task 11);
  `SocialHomeDTO.me.goodnight` and `camp.night|awake|asleep|goodnightOpen` (Task 8) are optional on mobile for S1
  servers; testIDs used by the Task 12–14 tests are the ones the components render.
- Review Focus lines each have a test: zones and midnight, incl. Auckland's goodnight seen from Los Angeles (Tasks 2,
  4, 6, 7), unpair/block/deletion and frozen nights (Tasks 6, 7, 9, 10), odd note text and no-logging (Tasks 5, 7, 8),
  goodnight edges incl. the goal-based window and undo after 06:00 (Tasks 2, 4, 6), old/new pairs (Tasks 11, 12, 13).
- Known costs, accepted: `/me/social` reads the circle's last 48 h of goodnights on every load (small rows, indexed
  by `at`); weeks cached before S2 keep S1 items until the next week; a `first_badge` (or a badge top story, as in S1)
  for a badge backfilled after its week was cached misses that week; a quiet week is rebuilt on every read for its
  first 24 h as final; the scene's seats are a fixed layout (tested free of overlap from 375 to 430 px wide; it needs
  336 px, so a narrower screen would clip the outer seats) whose bubbles are one line as wide as a seat; tonight's fire counts the live
  camp, so a buddy paired after 19:00 grows tonight's fire but not tonight's "lit night".
