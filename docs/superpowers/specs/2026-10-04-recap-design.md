# Recap — design (growth sub-project B)

Date: 2026-10-04 (revised after review the same day). Branch `feature/recap`, stacked on `feature/sleep-depth` (PR #48).
Source: the owner's picks on the growth canvas (https://claude.ai/artifact/JHqksi4S4DpFXNiFJho97e):
1 shareable recap card, 1a weekly story, 1b year in pixels, 1c build your recap, 1d your month in the app.

## Purpose

Growth. A user turns their week, month or year into a good-looking image in their coach's voice and shares it;
the image carries the app's name so friends can find the app. Success: a user can open a recap, choose what to
include, and save or share an image in a few taps, and every number on it is true.

## Decisions (owner)

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Coach quote | Written by the coach AI, number-checked, template fallback |
| Link on images | App name only for now (no URL) |
| Scope | All five screens in this sub-project |
| Ready notifications | Push on the 1st (month) and Monday (week), with a "Recap ready" setting |
| Approach | A — recaps prepared ahead on the server, rendered and shared on the phone |
| Existing weekly digest | **Merged** into the weekly recap: one Monday item, one push, one fact sheet |

Out of scope: buddies / other people (sub-project C), a public link or landing page, server-rendered images,
editing the coach's line.

## 1. What a recap contains

**Periods.** Week = Monday–Sunday in the user's time zone. Month = calendar month. A night belongs to the civil
date it ends on (as everywhere else in the app).

**Numbers** (each omitted, never zero-filled, when its own data is missing):

| Key | Definition |
|---|---|
| `nightsWithData` | Nights in the period with a SLEEP rollup |
| `avgSleepMinutes` | Mean SLEEP rollup minutes over those nights, rounded |
| `nightsOnGoal` | Nights with SLEEP rollup ≥ the goal snapshot |
| `longestOnGoalStreak` | Most consecutive civil dates on goal inside the period (a missing night breaks it) |
| `bestNight` | `{date, minutesAsleep}`: highest SLEEP DailyScore; ties → longer sleep; no scores → longest sleep |
| `bestRecovery` | `{date, score}`: highest RECOVERY DailyScore (rounded) |
| `avgRecovery` | Mean RECOVERY score, rounded |
| `steps` | `{total, dailyAverage}` from STEPS records on days with data |
| `earlierBedtimes` | `{nights, of}`: nights whose main-session bedtime (pickMainSession, noon-anchored minutes) was earlier than the previous period's average bedtime |
| `bedtimeSpreadMinutes` | Population std of noon-anchored bedtimes (the regularity spread maths), rounded; needs ≥ 4 nights |
| `weekStrip` (week only) | 7 entries Mon→Sun: `{date, minutesAsleep|null, onGoal|null, recovery|null}` |
| `comparison` | vs the previous period of the same kind: `avgSleepDelta`, `bedtimeSpreadDelta`, `avgRecoveryDelta` |
| `milestones` (month only) | See below |

**Previous period.** Comparison and `earlierBedtimes` are computed from **raw stored data** for the previous period
with the same definitions (not from a stored recap), so the first recap has a comparison whenever history exists.
Each comparison value is present only when the previous period meets the same eligibility threshold as the current
one (WEEK ≥ 3 nights, MONTH ≥ 7) and has that number.

**Monthly milestones** (fixed rules, only those achieved):
- `streak` — "N nights on goal in a row" when `longestOnGoalStreak` ≥ 5.
- `bestRecoveryWeek` — the Monday-start week (inside the month, ≥ 4 days of RECOVERY) with the highest mean
  recovery, shown only when it beats the previous month's best such week by ≥ 1 point (raw data).
- `everyDayLogged` — every civil date of the month has a SLEEP rollup.
- `steadiestMonth` — `bedtimeSpreadMinutes` is the lowest of all months computable from raw data, with ≥ 3
  earlier eligible months.

**Goal snapshot.** The user's sleep goal at build time is stored on the recap (`sleepGoalMinutes`) and used for
every on-goal number in that recap; it never changes afterwards.

**Year in pixels** is not stored: the app draws it from `GET /me/sleep` for the calendar year (one square per
night: on goal / short / no data) against the **current** goal, and says so under the grid ("on your current goal
of 8h"). Accepted consequence: after a goal change, the year count can differ from older monthly recaps, which keep
the goal they were built with; the caption makes the rule visible.

**Eligibility.** WEEK needs `nightsWithData` ≥ 3; MONTH needs ≥ 7. Below that the period is recorded as skipped
(no recap shown, no push).

## 2. Building, writing and announcing

**Schedule.** An hourly recap sweep on the existing `health-sync` repeatable-job machinery replaces the weekly
digest cron (`COACH_WEEKLY_DIGEST_CRON`). A period is **due** for a user when, in their time zone, the period has
ended, it is past 08:00 on any day after it ended, and it ended no more than **7 days** ago (WEEK) / **10 days** ago
(MONTH), and no `Recap` row exists for it. This survives a missed hour or a down day. One BullMQ job per due
(user, kind, periodStart), job id `recap-<userId>-<kind>-<periodStart>` (dedupes, `removeOnComplete: true`).
One user's failure never blocks others.

**Storage.** New Prisma model `Recap`: `id`, `userId`, `kind` (`WEEK|MONTH`), `periodStart`, `periodEnd`,
`status` (`BUILT|SKIPPED`), `stats` (JSON, section 1; null when skipped), `sleepGoalMinutes`, `line`, `lineSource`
(`AI|TEMPLATE`), `story` (the weekly paragraph, nullable, WEEK only), `storySource` (`AI|TEMPLATE`, nullable),
`personaId`, `builtAt`, `rebuiltAt` (null until the one allowed rebuild), `openedAt`, `pushedAt`.
Unique `(userId, kind, periodStart)`. SKIPPED rows mark thin-data periods so the sweep never retries them.
`Recap` is added to `USER_OWNED_MODELS` (users/deletion.ts) and its schema test; account deletion removes recaps.
Migration additive only.

**One fact sheet.** A new `recap` fact sheet (coach/answer/facts.ts) holds exactly the section-1 numbers. Every
count fact carries a count unit (`nights`, `days`, `times`, `steps`) and is marked exact.

**Stricter number check for recaps.** `validateSentence` gains an option `{ exactCounts: true }` used only by
recaps: a number matching a count fact must equal it exactly (no ±1, no hedge tolerance); a bare number with no
unit matches only a count fact with exactly that value; durations keep ±1 minute and scores keep exact integers.
Existing chat/digest behaviour is unchanged when the option is off.

**Coach text (AI).** From the one sheet, in the user's persona (name, tone, focus, verbosity) with the existing
disallowed-topics list, no medical claims, second person, numbers only from the sheet, and each comparison's
direction stated explicitly in the prompt:
- `line` — 1–2 sentences, ≤ 30 words (every recap).
- `story` — the merged weekly digest: the paragraph the digest used to write, now built from the recap sheet
  (WEEK only).
- Engine: the user's selected coach engine, as the daily one-liner chooses (`summaryEngineDeps`).
- Each output: every sentence through `validateSentence(…, { exactCounts: true })`; a rejected draft gets one retry
  with the regeneration note, then a template (lines: small fixed set per situation; story: the existing
  `composeDigestFallback` adapted to the recap sheet), templates also validated. 60 s budget per recap.
- Coach disabled or no current consent → no AI call: template line, no story. Persona `reactive-only` → template
  line, no story (the digest already skipped these users).

**Digest merge.** The weekly digest job stops being scheduled. `CoachDigest` rows stay for history.
`GET /me/coach/digests/latest` keeps its response shape but serves the latest BUILT WEEK recap's `story` (falling
back to the latest legacy `CoachDigest` when no recap with a story exists), so existing screens keep working.

**Ready push.** Pushes stay inside the closed table in coach/push.ts:
- WEEK reuses `weekly_digest` ("Your weekly recap is ready" / "Open the app to read it.").
- MONTH adds `monthly_recap` ("Your monthly recap is ready" / "Open the app to see it.").
- The payload gains an id-only `data` field `{ kind: 'recap', recapId }`. The push rule is amended in push.ts's
  header: data may carry only a fixed kind and an opaque UUID, never content; the Expo sender validates `data`
  against that allowlist (keys `kind`,`recapId`; `kind === 'recap'`; `recapId` a UUID) as it does title/body.
- Sent only when the user has a registered push token **and** `recapPushEnabled` is true; `pushedAt` prevents a
  second push; failures are logged and never fail the recap. SKIPPED periods never push.

**Notification setting.** New `User.recapPushEnabled Boolean @default(true)`; new routes
`GET /me/notifications` → `{ recapPushEnabled }` and `PUT /me/notifications` (partial, boolean validated, 400
`invalid_settings` otherwise).

**Late data (one rebuild).** The hourly sweep also checks BUILT recaps with `openedAt` null, `rebuiltAt` null and a
period that ended ≤ 3 days ago. If any input in the period changed after `builtAt` — a SLEEP or STEPS
`BiometricRecord.syncedAt`, or a `DailyScore` computed time — **and** scores have caught up (the latest DailyScore
computed time in the period is ≥ the latest rollup `syncedAt`), the recap is rebuilt (numbers and coach text) and
`rebuiltAt` set; if scores have not caught up it waits for a later hour inside the window. Opened or rebuilt recaps
never change. A rebuild does not push again.

**Launch backfill.** On first deploy a one-off job builds, per user, the last 4 weeks and last 3 months (AI text as
normal, `pushedAt` set so no push), so the Recaps screen is not empty.

**Endpoints.**
- `GET /me/recaps?kind=WEEK|MONTH&limit=` → BUILT recaps newest first (summary fields).
- `GET /me/recaps/:id` → full recap; pure read. Another user's id or a SKIPPED row → 404.
- `POST /me/recaps/:id/opened` → idempotently sets `openedAt` (called by the app when the recap is actually shown).

## 3. Screens, the image and sharing

**Entry points.** A "Your recaps" row on the Sleep screen opens a new **Recaps** screen (latest MONTH, latest
WEEK, older ones, and Year in pixels). Home shows a dismissible "Your {Month} recap is ready" / "Your week is ready"
card while the newest recap is unopened. The coach screen's weekly digest entry opens the WEEK recap's story.

**Push taps.** The notification response handler (cold start via the last response, warm via the listener) gains a
`recap` route: `data.kind === 'recap'` → navigate to that recap; other data is ignored as today. Cold-start and
warm-start taps are both tested. (A free-team device build cannot receive remote pushes; verify on the simulator
with a simulated push payload.)

**Screens.**
1. **Month in the app (1d)** — "{Month} with {Coach}", the line, milestones achieved, "Compared with last month"
   (avg sleep, bedtime spread, avg recovery with ± arrows; only present comparisons), "Make a shareable recap".
2. **Monthly card (1)** — "MY {MONTH}", pixel coach + name, the quote, up to four stats (avg sleep, longest
   streak, best recovery, steps), app name.
3. **Weekly story (1a)** — 9:16: "How {Coach} saw my week", Mon–Sun strip coloured by on goal, best night, the
   quote, app name; the in-app week view also shows the `story` paragraph under the card.
4. **Year in pixels (1b)** — grid, one cell per night of the calendar year (on goal / short / no data),
   "{N} nights on goal", "on your current goal of {goal}", app name; shareable.
5. **Build your recap (1c)** — format (monthly card 1:1, weekly story 9:16, year in pixels 1:1), include
   switches (each available stat, the quote, the coach character), live preview, "Only you see this until you
   share", **Save image** (Photos; asks permission first time) and **Share** (system share sheet). Switches for
   missing stats are hidden; choices persist per format in **SecureStore** (like the other device settings).

**Look.** App fonts (Geist, Instrument Serif), the user's pixel coach, app colours incl. the stage colours (year
pixels: on goal `sleepDeep`, short a muted track). Share images always render in the dark theme. In-app screens
follow light/dark.

**Image.** The on-screen preview is scaled to fit and is never captured. The export renders a separate **off-screen
view at a fixed logical size** — 360×360 (card, year) or 360×640 (story) — and captures it with Skia
`makeImageFromView` at pixel scale 3, giving 1080×1080 / 1080×1920 PNGs written to the cache directory, then saved
with `expo-media-library` or shared with `expo-sharing` (new native modules → one iOS rebuild).

**Privacy.** Nothing leaves the phone until Save/Share. Images never include name or email, and only the numbers
left switched on.

## 4. Errors and edge cases

- Thin data → SKIPPED row, no recap/push; per-stat omission; builder hides missing stats.
- Previous period thin or absent → no comparison / no earlier-bedtimes fact (so the coach can't mention them).
- Time zones → each user's own zone decides due-ness; nights keyed by their own end date.
- Server down on the Monday / the 1st → built later inside the 7 / 10-day window, still pushed once.
- Coach failures (down, slow, invalid twice, disabled, no consent) → template line; recap always built.
- Photos permission denied → Save explains how to allow it in Settings; Share still works. Capture failure → a
  short retry message.
- Account deletion → recaps removed via `USER_OWNED_MODELS`.

## 5. Testing

Backend (Jest, test DB): each number definition on hand-built periods (thin data, streak across a gap, first
period with and without earlier history, goal snapshot), previous-period comparison from raw data, milestone rules,
eligibility and SKIPPED rows, due-window maths (Monday 07:59 not due, Tuesday due, day 8 not due; same for months),
dedupe on rerun, late-data rebuild (sleep, steps and score changes; waits for scores; only once; never after open),
`exactCounts` validator (6 vs 5 nights rejected, bare numbers, hedges, existing callers unchanged), line and story
paths (AI accepted, invalid → retry → template, coach off/no consent/reactive-only → no AI call), digest endpoint
served from the WEEK recap, push kinds and `data` allowlist, `recapPushEnabled` and token gating, settings routes,
recap endpoints (404s, pure GET, idempotent opened), deletion test with `Recap` in `USER_OWNED_MODELS`, backfill.
Mobile (Jest/RNTL): each screen from a stored recap, builder switches change the preview, off-screen export size,
year-pixel colouring/count/caption, Save permission-denied path, Share called with the captured file, push-tap
routing cold and warm, Home ready card shows and dismisses, opened call made once.
Simulator/device: trigger a WEEK and MONTH build for the owner, simulated push tap, each screen, both share formats
and a saved image; light and dark in-app.

## 6. Rollout and risk

Additive migration; new native modules need a dev-client rebuild; the digest cron is replaced by the recap sweep in
the same deploy. Hosted coach cost: one or two calls per eligible user per week/month plus the one-off backfill.
Remaining risk: comparison direction words ("higher"/"lower") are not checked by the validator; mitigated by stating
direction in the prompt and by templates.

## 7. Rulings made in revision (owner may override)

- Comparison and earlier-bedtimes use raw previous-period data, not stored recaps.
- Year in pixels uses the current goal and says so; monthly recaps keep their snapshot.
- Due window 7 days (WEEK) / 10 days (MONTH); SKIPPED rows for thin periods.
- Late-data rebuild covers sleep, steps and scores, waits for scores, happens at most once, only before opening.
- Launch backfill: last 4 weeks + 3 months with AI text, no push.
- Opening is a separate POST, not a side effect of GET.
- Reactive-only personas get a template line and no story (as the digest did).
